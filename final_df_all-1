It is refreshing and so delicious, and is also very good in lemonade. I am a trained aromatherapist and as such, am very familiar with the health benefits associated with lavender. I have included some of them below:<br /><br />Lavender is an excellent nerve tonic that may help treat migraines, headaches, anxiety and nervous tension. It is often used for insomnia in smaller amounts; in larger amounts has been used to increase mental activity. Lavender has been used extensively to treat burns and pain associated with sore muscles and joints. It helps restore hormonal balance and may reduce associated menstrual cramping. Lavender is widely used for respiratory ailments, colds, flu and sinus congestion. Added to a beverage, lavender is soothing for sore throats and laryngitis. Lavender stimulates the production of gastric juices and bile and thus aiding in treatment of indigestion, stomach pain, colic, flatulence, vomiting and diarrhea. Regular use of lavender essential oil is said to provide resistance to disease.<br /><br />UPDATE: Bebop Trading Co. is the absolute WORST vendor I have ever dealt with on Amazon. I placed a re-order with them and was very unhappy. They are playing a little game on here by offering the product at $5 and then charging $10 for the shipping.

Did some research on the internet, including watching videos of people eating dried Ghost Chilis, and still thought ""no way are they that much hotter than a Habenero.""  They are.  So hot, in fact, that the huge bag of dried Bhut Jolokai peppers I recieved in the mail is enough to last for years- a half-teaspoon of the dried peppers ground up is enough to make a huge pot of chili very hot, the same amount in a container of home-made salsa renders it un-edible by all but a very few ""hot-heads.""  Smoky and spicy at the same time, it has a heat that builds a little slower than other hot peppers and lingers longer, with a definite sinus-clearing component and a catch in your throat.  For super spicy food lovers only, be careful when handling them as well.",0.996926

After doing a lot of research for healthy chocolate flavored drinks that are were non dairy, this was the best of all the findings.<br /><br />PROS: Scruptious. Rich, thick, and pleases the tongue and mouth. Small and perfect sizing (though I drink 2 boxes). If you've had kidney failure or medical restrictions, this was wonderful to find! Often, with kidney restrictions, you can NOT have high protein, which both dairy and SOY drinks have. This has close to zero grams of protein. Also, if you're a vegan, dairy free. Gluten free. cholesterol free, 0% iron, which I have to look out for too. Doesn't have to be refrigerated. Natural ingredients (nothing artificial).<br /><br />CONS: Product is hard to find, at least anywhere locally. Amazon is great since it qualifies for free s&h, where other places charge way too much. If you have healthy kidneys would be disappointed how there is no protein or calcium. Low in vitamins/minerals (which can be good in way that not artificially added). If you write to the company, don't expect a response! I tried writing twice with compliments and questions; never responded to me. Also, straws don't work too well- end up peeling tab at opening and sip/pouring in rest.<br /><br />Overall, two thumbs up. Enjoy!",0.9986215

Lets start with that. HEY AMAZON, whoever works in your shipping department should be fired. This case of chili was in a box about 8 inches larger than the case itself, no problem there. But only 1 piece of brown packing paper was used, and it was placed on top of the chili. There was no packing around the sides of the case, so this chili was sliding around in this box and tearing the box up. A few of the cans were dented, but no problem there. I worked in shipping and receiving before, and if anything was packed in this manner, it would be totally unacceptable. I am surprised UPS even accepted the package the way the case was sliding around in the box. Ok, enough of that. On to the chili itself.<br /><br />I bought this because I had read so many reviews about how Wolf chili is supposed to be the best. Well, I gotta say that it doesnt even come close to the best. First of all, open the can and pour it into the pot. Thats right, pour. The consistency of this chili is almost like soup. Any other can of chili you would either have to shake vigorously out of the can or spoon it out, but this stuff just pours out. And I think there was beef in it, but it must have been ground up so small that it was hardly noticable, again, adding to that watery consistency.<br /><br />As for the taste, well, it aint bad, but again, nowhere near the best. But the consistency of the chili and the taste combined? Makes you wonder how anyone can rave about this stuff. 4/10 at best, and thats being kind.<br /><br />If you want the best, I would go with Stagg. Many different flavors and a much higher quality, and better consistency.",0.08149568

Rusch,0,1,2,1327708800,Not a fan of this blend,"Coffee is a very subjective thing.  Some people like coffee that borders on tea, others like the stuff that a certain national chain named after a famous Battlestar Galactica pilot serves.  For the record, I love the slightly-sour taste of Dunkin Donuts coffee and I find the stuff made by ""that other chain"" to be akin to re-hydrated cigarette ash.  For many years, we still percolated coffee...with most big-name brands of pre-ground coffee, you needed a percolator to bring out the flavor in it, but again, your tastes may vary.<br /><br />With my Keurig, my favorite coffee was Paul Neumans Extra Bold....because it didn't seem Extra Bold.  Until you buy 80 of them and get tired of the flavor.  Then, my favorites were the Caribu's....but something happened to that brand (see reviews) and I agree, they did something...either they don't put as much in the cups or they changed the blend, the sourcing of the beans, etc......wasted money on Caribu and wont go back to the brand.<br /><br />So Wolfgang Puck got the nod, tried 4 different flavors.  This one, Sorrento, is not my favorite of the bunch (currently Colombian Chef's Reserve).  It has a bolder strength (which I believe hard core coffee drinkers would consider Medium), but to me it has a simple burnt flavor to it.  Cream and Sweetener don't correct for this, and thus I'm a bit disappointed....but again it was a stab in the dark.<br /><br />I think if you prefer a slightly bolder, slightly more burnt flavor in your coffee...this may be for you.  I like the character of the Colombian Chef's Reserve, but it is not as strong, and perhaps that is just what my taste is slanted towards.  I don't believe you can get a bad cup of coffee in the Wolfgang Puck line however.  Can't say the same for some other K-cup brands.",0.12487727

Too much weight and the cans begin to buckle and this buckling will look like dents.  You can also get this same effect if the warehousemen are slamming the 12 pack cans down hard on top of each other.  This happens when workers in the warehouse get tired and become careless, are untrained, or just plain don't care about their job.  If you want to feel better then stay on a low salt diet, if you have ankle swelling then get on a low salt diet and get checked for congestive heart failure.  If you have high blood pressure get on a low salt diet and then increase your intake of magnesium.  Backing off your salt is not easy as it begins to change the way you taste food but if you stay with it and get off the high salt diet you will begin to taste food and not just the salt.  Have you ever eaten at a restaurant where the cook's salt intake is so high that the cook can't tell if he has too much salt in the food he is preparing?  I have more than once and it just destroys the meal.  Instead of buying 12 cans now try the Amy's Low Salt by getting it at your local health food store one can at a time then if you like order from Amazon and save.  Right now they have a 25% discount code when you order.  Write it down and use it as it saved me a few bucks.  Hope this review helps you.",0.99225897

Today she gets some of this in her stocking for Christmas, and every once in awhile I buy it for her for her as a surprise.  This candy never, ever, ceases to bring a smile to her face.  I love that, because she will be thirty someday and I know that this candy will still make her smile.  This will be one of her childhood memories.<br /><br />If you haven't tried Choco Baby, it's basically guinea pig pellet-shaped pieces of blandly flavored chocolate.  It's like human pellet treat.  If it was made by Nutro or Friskies it would be labeled ""Human Treat Pellets -- Chocolate-Flavored"".  Some of the pellets have little stars on the ends of them.  The stuff tastes pretty good.  It's not Sno Caps or anything (my favorite chocolate of all time), but it's good.  It has a fun name.  It's Asian.  Whatever.<br /><br />Buy some.",0.9805744

I prepare another pot that heats up the soup separately and after draining the noodles (because the water gets starchy and the soup has a cloudy look to it) I pour the soup over the noodles with bean sprouts, chinese red pork (char siu)or left over beef steak or spam cut up into bits that will fit on my chinese soup spoon. Bits of spam is one of my favorite meats to eat with because its saltiness gives the soup base another dynamic flavor along with Tobasco Sauce. When eaten with chinese red pork there's another tasty dimension and leftover steak (usually NY or rib eye) makes for a hefty beefy brothy change. Sprinkle fresh cut green onions and I don't know how you can go to a Pho' shop. When I use the chinese red pork I keep it out of the soup till it is joined with the noodles otherwise your broth turns a not so appetizing red. Snap peas, bean sprout, cabbage and any of your other crunchy vegetables will make this dish fit for a King.<br />  One improvement I wish Sapporo Ichiban would make is: add about 10-20% more noodles. 2 packages is a bit more than my bowl or my stomach can take but I find myself running out of noodles and the meat, vegetables and broth populate the bottom of the bowl.<br />  I've been having this for breakfast every day during a work week for the past 3 years I believe and wonder when I'll break this culinary habit. I've alternated my meats and vegetables around this Ichiban dish which probably has me thinking that I'm getting a variety making my obsession last this long. I guess the change to french toast and bacon on the weekends has helped.<br />  Of course, you know that in Hawaii it is called Saimin. After a high school game, dance or event we would head over to the Saimin House in Kalihi and along with Teriyaki sticks would wolf down a large bowl.

Back in late October 2011 I switched to Blue Buffalo after it was recommended by a family member. By mid-November Calla started to cry out at night.  We thought it might be a back issue and our ""Three"" yes three Vets agreed that it could be Intervertebral Disc Disease.  We had blood work done in November and everything looked fine with the exceptions that she was a ""little"" dehydrated. After months of treatments, with little to no improvement we thought it might be a stomach issue and I started to think about the timing of the change to Blue Buffalo, then I went and goggled ""Consumer complaints about Blue Buffalo Pet Foods"" and started to really connect the dots.  Yesterday she was diagnosed with ""Pancreatitis"" and needs to be in the hospital for days for treatment.  I have spent over 3K to this point and do not know if Calla will ever recover fully from this.  She was a completely healthy dog before we changed to Blue Buffalo and since have been living in Hell with nighty episodes.

My dogs did eat this food, but after reading the ingredients I completely regret purchasing it and feel just awful for feeding it to my dogs. The first three ingredients are Ground yellow corn, chicken by-product meal, and corn gluten meal. How disgusting is that?! The main ingredient is a corn filler. One thing my vet told me a while back that I never forgot: ""When you eat corn, what comes out of the other end? The same thing happens with dogs."" Basically, dogs cannot digest corn, it is just a filler and causes them to actually eat more to feel full, poop out more, and retain less nutrients. The only meat in Beneful at all is a by-product, its not even a real meat! By-products are the stuff leftover once all the actual meat is harvested. We're talking beaks, chicken feet, eyeballs, even chicken poop! I would not recommend this product to anyone, for any reason, ever. It is an absolutely awful dog food. I can't believe the pictures of veggies and full chunks of meat on the bag can be allowed to be on the packaging of such a disgusting product; it is very misleading and should be considered false advertising.<br /><br />I recommend to stay far away from Beneful, and most Purina products. When purchasing a dog (or cat) food, the most important thing to consider is the first 3 ingredients; just make sure those first three are decent ingredients that you would eat yourself.

This particular brand is tenderized and flavored with fruit juices, and is moist inside the bag. The meat is very juicy and tender, with a nice, but not overpowering, note of sweetness to it. It's not sour, as the description erroneously says. Also please disregard the strange Genmaicha Green Tea inset in the photo. It's obviously a mistake. Reviewer Mary is right that it should be about $1 an ounce, or maybe just slightly more due to inflation.<br /><br />I highly recommend trying this product if you've never tasted Chinese-styled beef jerky. It is an excellent and tasty treat. The spicy fruit flavored variety is also fantastic and even better than this one if you like a bit of kick.

As wine & beer making have several steps over time I will update this review as I proceed through all the steps. This is a very heavy container.  Getting that bag empty will be the trickiest part of the wine kit I think. I was simply not strong enough to pick up the bag of 'must' from the bucket shipping container. What I did was to dump the contents of the shipping bucket into my plastic food grade fermentation vessel.<br /><br />Because I couldn't lift the bag out of the primary I had to cut a hole in the bag as near to the bottom as possible and lift the bag out of the primary as the bag drained.  This was still a tricky procedure as the 'must' initially just pooled on top of the 23 liter bag of must.  I think next time I try one of these 55 lbs kits I am going to borrow my step-son who works unloading UPS trucks everyday and is strong as a horse to hold the bag of must clear of the 'primary' while I open the bag the proper way and let it drain into the primary.<br /><br />I have at the time of this writing transferred the juice/must to my plastic primary fermentation vessel, added the bentonite, stirred, added the yeast, and stirred again.  I don't take the specific gravity as I like my wines very dry and so I just let them ferment out completely.  I do like that the kit includes corks (one less thing to purchase).",0.5310934

However, I liked the idea that they are healthier than regular chips and I figured they would be great for school lunches, quick snacks, etc. I decided to give them a try and figured if we did not like them, they could be donated.  I ordered a mixed case the first time around to see which flavors we liked more (or less) and thought that would give us a good sampling.  After deciding we liked most of the flavors, we decided to try other ones as well.<br /><br />Despite the flavor preferences, these chips do not taste like cardboard.  At first taste, they are a little crunchier and thicker than you might expect. I think this is a good thing, because it means they are not heavily-laden with oil.  The 0.8 oz bags are 100 calories each as well, which is much better than the other alternatives and gives you the enjoyment of chips without the extra calories, trans fat, etc.<br /><br />I have included a summary of opinions below from myself, friends and family for each flavor:<br /><br />Sea Salt & Vinegar - Great, the absolute favorite flavor for everyone<br />BBQ - Very good, I'm not crazy about BBQ to begin with but would say this flavor is ""sweet"" BBQ. Everyone else loved them.<br />Cheddar - Very Good, probably close in preference to the BBQ<br />Original Potato - Good, but a little salty (seems to fluctuate somewhat between bags)<br />Salt & Pepper - Good, everyone liked them but preferred other flavors more<br />Parmesan Garlic - Good, but overall was 50/50. You definitely taste more parmesan than garlic and most people were expecting the latter.<br />Sour Cream & Onion - Not so good, no one really liked these enough to want more or to even finish the bag<br /><br />I know taste is a very subjective thing, but I hope this review helps someone decide to give these a try. I did get them at a reduced price through subscribe & save, and shortly after my first order, Amazon had them on the Gold Box for an even better price.  I think the average price per bag came out to approximately forty six cents a bag and had free shipping under my prime account.",0.999031

I can enjoy food in moderation that I was denying myself.  I say moderation, because xylitol can cause soft or even liquid stool if you overdo it.  It's not safe for pets because they get severe hypoglycemia quickly which can kill them, especially puppies and kittens.  What I do is mix this with stevia drops and I can then use that concentration for coffee and tea all day without ill effects.  I feel I need to address some reviews that people have on xylitol, not necessarily from Now foods specifically.  I am concerned about people buying a new product without checking what it is and then giving it bad reviews for effects written clearly on the bag.  It would be different if the manufacturer was being deceptive but honestly, don't feed your kids something if you don't know what it is and then want it taken off the market.  For some people this is a miracle food.  Research any food you are going to put into your body or even bring into your home.  It is not a manufacturers job or governments job to tell you what to eat.  I'm not saying this to be mean, it's just that we've become way too passive about our own responsibility.",0.7705119

On the side they had ""Natures Sport's Drink"".  I never thought of Coconut Water as a sports drink but I thought I would give it a try.<br /><br />The package the drink comes in is ""Tetra Pak""; which is a fancy way of saying juice box.  Because this seems very similar to the way I used to drink my Hi-C Juice when I was in grade school.  No straw here though, just a foil covered hole in which you peel off the foil to drink.<br /><br />Ingredients are as follows: Natural coconut water, pink guava puree, cane juice, vitamin c, and natural fruit flavor.  Not too bad, sounds good, you have to add vitamin c to give the drink a little zing otherwise it comes off too bland, and they at least admit to adding ""natural fruit flavor"" which if you read the FDA website doesn't really have to be that natural at all.  But all-in-all the ingredients list looks good.  One container is 8.5 ounces, one serving, and you have 78 calories, no fat, 128mg of sodium, 302mg potassium, 18.8g of carbs, with .5g of that being fiber and 16.6g being sugar.  You also get 0.8g of protein and the added vitamin c gives 183% of your daily value.  Let's move on to taste:<br /><br />Serve cold, shake well, and open...tastes like coconut and guava.  I guess I should have expected that.  It feels fairly light on the tongue, not that oily mouth coating feel you get from regular coconut water.  O.N.E. claims they get the water form green coconuts before the meat forms, so that accounts for the lack of oils and fats.  So you get nice tropical flavor.  Like a really watered down pina colada.  Sadly I am unable to perform blood work and tell you if my electrolytes are being replenished but I am enjoying the flavor.  So if coconut and guava appeal to you, and you would like those flavors in a natural sports drink, this may be the drink for you.",0.95238227

The HealthWise has the coarsest grind, this Hevla one is the middle grind and the Puroast is the fine grind.  With taste being pretty equal, the Hevla came out to be the most expensive at approximately 1.79 per ounce, the HealthWise at .87 per ounce, and the Puroast at .50 per ounce.  Some people may find taste differences, but we just thought they all tasted like coffee.  So with all other things being equal, we will probably stick to the Puroast and the HealthWise since the Hevla is twice as much as the Healthwise and more than three times as much as the Puroast.  I will note that customer service with the Hevla is more frequent and personal, so if that is a very important factor to you, then that is actually what you are paying for.

Boil 5 minutes, then strain through a paper towel lined mesh sieve, then cool it in the fridge. Once cold, it should be sweetened, I add simple syrup since it dissolves faster than sugar ( boil equal amounts of sugar and water, then cool and use to sweeten anything) and mix well, then pour over ice and top with evaporated milk. I drink it though a straw, and even add bubbles ( tapioca pearls) for a bubble tea like drink.

He suggested I gradually shift the dog to Blue, which has a similar protein/carbohydrate mix, and then when the puppy is a bit older (around a year), move to a food with a higher protein content.  (To ease the puppy into a new diet, he suggested I start by mixing 1/4 cup new food with 3/4 old food for a few days, then half and half, etc).  He also recommended that I mix in a couple of tablespoons of canned food with some water, just to make the dry food moist.  (He said the nutritional content of the canned food isn't as important, since the dry food will provide most of the substance, and that I can vary the canned food.)

About ¾ of an inch long, it's a nice reward without giving too much of a treat. The treats have a line in the middle for those who want to break the treat in half. Additionally, with a higher quality product, you do not have grease residue left on your fingers from handling the treats.<br /><br />What I don't like:<br />When you try to break the treats in half, a lot of times it crumbles in your hands and you lose a portion of the treat.  Also, my picky Springer isn't sure about the taste. He'll start eating the treat and spit it out. My Beagle devours them, so it may not be a concern for every consumer. This is the main reason I rated the treat at 4, it may not be something appetizing to discriminating eaters.

Truly terrible. Inedible, even. It's not just because it is sugar-free. Of course sugar-free cake is going to be a little different and less rich. But this is way, way worse than other sugar-free baked goods. I have had sugar-free chocolate cake and loved it. THIS mix is terrible. There are many reasons:<br /><br />- The batter is like a mousse, that just gets hard when it bakes. So it looks like crap because it doesn't smooth out as it bakes. Every spoon-mark is still there when you pull it out of the oven. It looks really weird. You could not serve it to company.<br />- The cooking time on the box (for the loaf pan) is ten minutes too long.<br />- There is no ginger taste, or cinnamon, nutmeg, or spice flavour in this ""ginger"" bread. It is flat and tasteless.<br />- The lack of other flavours allows the nasty aftertaste from the Sweet & Low(tm) to bloom with full force.<br />- The gingerbread is lacking in body, because it is as light and fluffy as a mousse. It is not helpful for dieters because it is not satisfying to eat because when you eat it, you feel like you haven't eaten anything. Strangely, this gingerbread mousse is also rubbery. Rubbery stiff mousse that dissolves in your mouth.<br /><br />The overall experience is like biting into a vaguely sweet sponge. Then it dissolves. And then the bitter chemical aftertaste kicks in.<br /><br />I have NO IDEA how a slice of this gingerbread could be 160 calories. There's nothing in it, it tastes nasty, and it is gross to chew on! You can have a gingerbread Pop Tart(tm) for 200 calories, or a bakery gingerbread cookie for 120 calories, and they are full of fat and sugar. How can this sugar-free, taste-free, light and fluffy rubber crap be 160 calories?",0.041995727

Very musky but weirdly comforting.  I have tried it with peppermint, turmeric (for a different affliction) and I have tried it plain with stevia and it taste okay to me.  I wouldn't say I have an iron stomach because I can easily get sick if food is left out in the open not at the proper temperature.

For those with sensitive noses and sense of taste, you have been amply warned by other reviewers.

All you need to do first is drain them and rinse them very well in a colander/strainer, rinse them until they do not smell. Second, cut them up, they usually are very very long, and than put them in a hot pan on medium heat so that the water will evaporate and while i do that i continue to blot them with paper towels, until they are very dry.

I usually order these by the mini-case.  Shippers will not guaratee against breakage if you order single boxes.  Mini-cases usually have special packing (I order from Bulk Foods and have never had trouble with breakage).  The better shippers will also ship with blue ice packs for an added charge (the blue ice packs can be reused).  Prices vary depending on the source.  Ordering by the mini-case, you can usually get a discounted price and free shipping, but you have to check around among the sources.<br /><br />The candy sticks themselves are the best variety that I have found.  The individual wrappers are all marked with the flavors.  Flavors are comparable with candy sticks from other manufacturers.  You can order specific flavors (orange, bubble gum, cotton candy, etc., depending on the source).  Orange is a good color for Halloween, or you can order red (cherry) and green (lime) for Christmas colors, or possibly the barber pole peppermint sticks.<br /><br />A mini-case may sound like a lot, but friends can combine orders.  Personally, I had about 400 trick or treaters last Halloween, and two sticks per child gives them a little variety and makes a good treat.  I ordered a mini-case of 12 boxes, gave one box to a merchant friend for her store, and had a few left for Christmas (they are colorful and can be used in stockings, gift bags, or added as ornaments to wrappings).",0.9905649

The loaf came out three inches high...hhmmmm.....<br />I did some digging around and came across an old book Smart Bread Machine Recipes by Sandra Woodruff. 1994<br />She only uses whole grain flours.  What I was lacking was Vital Gluten as many of the flours in this mix are very low in natural gluten.<br />Now I have wonderful bread that rises properly and it is soooo good. Just the right amount of texture and nutty taste. So looking forward to experimenting as I love Russian Black Bread.<br />As for having to add the gluten, my thought is that older bread machines must have either a shorter rise time or lower temps or both, because I do not see gluten as an ingredient on newer bread machine recipes that use whole wheat and other whole grain flours -- I find on the web. And I read reviews that stated that they used the recipe on the bag and had no problems with rising.  So that is my the theory.... it's my very old machine.<br />And what does a single person do with 20 pounds of flour ... I vacuum sealed three bags and put them in the freezer.<br />And thanks to the reviewer that stated they used it for cookies... heck never thought of that... but now I will.....oh and baked donuts made with honey....",0.99059784

It was the most delectable coconut milk I could find anywhere. The five star reviews were spot on. Loved it!<br /><br />Then all the sudden I started receiving a completely different product in a can with the same label. It seemed like very, VERY watered down coconut milk with coconut oil added to it. The result was a liquid with oil solids (translucent like coconut oil) throughout. It didn't matter how much I shook the can (or heated the unopened can in hot water before shaking) it was a disgusting, unusable, oily slop! If I refrigerated an open can the oil would rise to the top and form a solid top layer. I've never seen any other brand of coconut milk do this.<br /><br />The cans do say ""Product of SRI LANKA"" in spite of the Amazon listing stating it is from Thailand. I suspect this it the reason for the poor quality. I would bet that the cans that have labels stating it was from Thailand are the real Native Forest Coconut Milk and the Sri Lanka cans are some sort of evil Doppelg&auml;nger!<br /><br />UPDATE 3/15/2012<br />Due to new reviews I decided to give the product a try once again. Looks like Amazon or Native Forest has addressed the issue of the inferior product from Sri Lanka. I have recieved several 12 packs and all have been from Thailand, all have been super creamy and delicious. Thank goodness. I love this product.<br /><br />Also wanted to thank Amazon who always refunded my money when I complained about the Sri Lankan slop.",0.033874344

It's very easy and fun to make, and pretty much all of the jelly like food is grape flavor but it's not to strong and it's sweet, some is sour but not very, I hate sour stuff but I could easily eat this, so no worries. The best part I think, was making the salmon roe eggs with the water dropper. It shipped to me in about a week, getting here just one day after it said it would.

Skip the dip; balance the tangy chips by alternating bites of raw vegetable.<br /><br />As an Oregonian, I'm proud to share these delectable snacks with friends, especially those living outside our state and who haven't experienced gourmet chips. I tell them Kettle Brand does for potato chips what microbrews did for beer.<br /><br />Kettle Brand potato chips are unmistakable--a light gold color, rich flavor and amazing crunch. Kettle Brand chips are also a healthier snacking option than the major chip brands. Kettle Brand chips don't have trans fats, MSG or artificial flavors and colorings. The company also has a line of organic potato chips and all of their products are certified Kosher.<br /><br />I also recommend <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G6MBV4"">Kettle Chips Honey Dijon</a> and <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G6Q4GM"">Kettle Chips Spicy Thai</a>.<br /><br />Annette Solomon, a reporter for the Salem Statesman Journal recently noted that a glass of wine goes nicely with these chips. Solomon wrote, ""...you could be missing out on a wonderful pairing. These chips are spicy, so you would want to select a semi-sweet white wine. Also, a moderate amount of acid will subdue the strong flavors of ginger, lime, garlic and cilantro without over-powering them. Classically, a German-style Riesling fits these parameters perfectly.""",0.9759011

I looked online for a good recipe but in the end I did the most basic thing and I think I will stick with it:<br /><br />How I made it:<br /><br />1. 1 cup oats<br />2. 6 cups water<br />3. little salt<br /><br />Bring water to a boil, add oats, and set timer to 40 minutes on low to medium heat. Stir occasionally.<br /><br />Many recipes called for 3-4 cups of water so I started with 4 cups. However I had to continuously add hot water because the oats were not cooked to my liking. I also found that 4 cups of water was just not sufficient because the oats were starting to burn in the pot. So in the end, 6 cups of water and 40 minutes was best for me.<br /><br />I have to say, even without any flavoring (honey, nuts, cinnamon, etc), the oats taste really good.<br /><br />For consumption, I added some skim milk, drop of honey, and walnuts. This made of a healthy and filling breakfast.",0.96830374

The colors are about an equal mix of orange, yellow, red-tipped white and red-tipped pink.  (It never occurred to me to expect any red roses, but I'll mention there were none for the sake of people who seem to expect some.)

I like Wellness, I consistently buy the hard food and one of my cats really enjoyed their sliced chicken in the 3 oz cans.  The only reason I tried this was because the other cat wouldn't eat the chicken slices and the the 3 oz cans are too expensive to keep wasting on him and I didn't want to have to buy different food for each.

Normally I only review a product all on its own because other factors are incidental, but this time it seemed fitting to comment on shipping too because it drastically affected the overall quality of the product and is an unavoidable part of getting it to any customer.<br /><br />The product arrives in a small cardboard flat with 2 layers of 12 cans each, then the whole thing is shrink-wrapped in plastic.  Then they put it in a shipping box and put 3 air pillows on top.  Exactly 1/2 of the cans arrived dented (the entire bottom tier of the flat), many of them so badly that it looked like they had been run over by a car.<br /><br />Amazon.com customer service is great and responsive - they shipped the replacement out with complimentary next-day shipping... and it arrived in exactly the same condition.  In the end, I got everything I paid for, but 1. do I want to go through this every time I order it? No.  And 2. it's hugely wasteful because of course the dented cans are unusable because the seal could be compromised, offering the perfect breeding ground for botulism.<br /><br />I can fairly say that this is typcial for canned products in general from Amazon, too.  I've gotten black beans, kidney beans, chick peas, tomato sauce, and tomato paste from them, and there wasn't one order among them that didn't have the same problem.  Again, customer service was great and sent quick replacements (again with a high damage rate), but it's not worth the hassle and waste.

So far, the best I've gotten out of her was ""That's....interesting."" Ah well, more for me. London Fogs, also known as an Earl Grey with vanilla and milk, are her favorite winter drink, so that's what I had in mind when I snagged this little beauty. That and she's a sucker for anything Earl Grey. But I'm looking forward to mixing this with, you guessed it, vanilla. An Earl Grey/vanilla was my very first tea, though I'm not much of an Earl Grey fan nowadays. But still, it sounded very tasty and I had to at least try it. I'm a bit worried, after the bitterness of the lemon matcha, but I was worried about the watermelon and it turned out amazing. And we're big fans of the Earl Grey from Red Leaf Teas around here, so we have a lot of faith in this blend. Their Earl Grey Oolong is one of the teas my wife absolutely cannot do without, and their Raspberry Earl Grey was one of the few teas I've actually seen her mourn when it was discontinued. So yes, if there was ever an Earl Grey matcha to get her into matcha, it would have to be from Red Leaf Tea.<br /><br />Success! We went to the zoo on Friday and my poor wife was only running on a couple hours sleep, so I made her a matcha London Fog and she loved it. Loved it! I stole a few sips of the Earl Grey before mixing it in with everything else and it was perfect Earl Grey, and I knew that I'd made the right choice. I mixed together equal parts Earl Grey matcha and French Vanilla matcha (both from Red Leaf Tea, of course) and whisked it together in a bowl to be sure to get all the lumps out. Personally I don't care about a clump or matcha or two, but it really turns her off of her drink. Anyway, I heated up some vanilla soy milk, frothed it up, added it to the blend and it was perfect. She loved it! And it's so much better for you than the regular London Fog, full of syrup and dairy...blegh.

We were buying the small bags of birch xylitol, but went looking for something else due to cost. We are a family of three and all of us love yummy, sweet, creamy tea. I was not loving the sugar, though! My husband is diabetic and I was worried about my son having all that sugar. Sometimes I still use honey with my son, but my husband has completely switched to xylitol. After extensive research I think that I am okay using non-GMO corn xylitol. Honestly, I can't tell a flavor difference and the price comparison is huge.<br /><br />Pros:  Very good value for your money!  Great for families or people who do a lot of cooking. Bakes like sugar in the recipes we have done. It isn't quite as sweet as sugar and since we've been used to using it almost exclusively our taste buds have gotten used to it. Now, when I go out and I am offered a treat, or get one at a restaurant, I can't take the sweetness. I've gotten so I never eat dessert or snack on sweet things. I just don't like them anymore. I'm healthier and my husband is healthier. My son, who is seven, also never snacks on sweet things or even asks for them (with the exception of ice cream, sometimes). I think this is because he is used to not having them around. If he wants a snack he usually asks for things like crackers and goat cheese or fruit. I only mention this about my son because I have noticed that his peers are always snacking on really sugary things, things that now make my taste buds shudder.<br /><br />Cons:  The large size is a bit unwieldy and the zip-lock type closure doesn't work very well, at least on ours. Since I am a stickler for not having our food open to the elements we have had to invest in a large container for food storage.

Drinking the beverage straight from the cans doesn't quite cut it (it tastes a bit metallic) and I've had to pour the stuff in a glass with ice.  Perhaps the absorption of the ice takes away part of the bitterness, but I've found the drink tastes much better this way.  But, overall, you'd best just avoid buying the stuff altogether.",0.059487857

I just love to try the neat regional sodas that you just can't get anywhere but a limited area. Moxie fits that bill, as it might not be found in the local grocery. Having heard about America's longest continually produced soda from 1884 for many years, I finally determined to try one. They say it takes nerve to drink a Moxie. I learned you can throw all of your normal conceptions of soda out the window when it comes to the taste of Moxie.<br /><br />It has less carbonation than most sodas, so some people think it goes flat fast. It is just that is has less fizz to begin with, and that is OK since too much fizz actually masks the flavor in many sodas. It also has much less sugar than most sodas, only 25 grams per 8 ounce serving rather than the 40 plus grams of most sodas. The flavor is spicey, as in pepper - not Dr Pepper but peppery. It has a strong hot bite to it that some people say reminds them of medicine. It has a strong aftertaste. And that aftertaste stays with you for awhile, which is good if you like the flavor. I like Moxie better when I first taste it in my mouth as that is when the sweet part hits you, (it seems at first like Mr. Pibb) rather than a few seconds after I drink it until you get used to it. The taste is unusual enough that I hear New Englanders pride themselves on their ability to get used to the taste and like it. It is definitely an acquired taste. I myself noted that it tasted better the second day than the first, and the next day and so forth. Of course this is how we learn to like the taste of things like coffee. It is very dark like a cola, and it has caffeine. Today it is owned by Monarch in Atlanta, Georgia now. For another unusual but delicious regional soda at Amazon, try Cheerwine.",0.9926764

An object on the xray led the vet to think that she had cancer.  After 5 days of anguish thinking my cat was dying, they did an ultrasound which revealed either an ulcer or a reactive lymph node related to the gastrointestional tract.  The vet feels there was an intolerance or allergy to the food which has caused the GI/node issues.  My cat will remain on the medications for another 10 days. Then we will ultrasound again, and perhaps surgery will be required.  This has cost about $1200 so far and I would not recommend this food to anyone.",0.9344921

I found it excellent---I really liked it. I left the tea bag in as I drank the tea (the whole time, much longer than recommended), which turns most teas bitter, but not this one. So far, this has been my experience with all of the St. Dalfour's teas that I have tried, a big selling point for me since I enjoy my teas very strongly brewed.<br /><br />St. Dalfour is a French firm that makes natural teas, including this organic tea. There is not a lot of information about them on their web site beyond the basics, but what is there looks good.<br /><br />St. Dalfour's Organic Strawberry Tea is a nice variation on plain black tea.

It has started to become very hard to find good Black Licorice in my area so after various attempts (both positive and negative) I figured I would try out the Haribo brand.  Not only is the price very fair (per pound), but the taste is outstanding.  This isn't your every day black licorice, and in my opinion ( and my mother's ) has a much more authentic taste to it.<br /><br />These remind me a bit of the Red-Vine European style black licorice that my mother also likes, but Haribo wheels pack more flavor into them.  The product itself comes in a 5lb bag, like the preview image shows.  The wheels are essentially thin strips of black licorice wound up into a wheel/snail-shell design.  I find the best way to eat them is to slowly unravel the wheel then attack slow and steady.  The flavor comes across very subtle at first, but the longer the licorice piece sits on your tongue the more the flavor begins to bloom.<br /><br />Haribo Black Licorice Wheels taste outstanding, and to top it off the price is rather cheap per pound.  On sale these were just $2.96/lb which is pretty cheep for licorice of this quality.  If you are a black licorice lover then look no further.<br /><br />*NOTE: The back the product comes in does not contain nutritional information.

If you like freshly ground spices this is the way to go.  Allspice, Pepper, Cloves, Cinnamon are just a few of the spices that I use with this mortar and pestle.  When it comes to garlic and onion I use a pharmacist's glass mortar and pestle.  The reason is that marble is a porous substance and there can be a flavor carry over from one use to the next. I also use a porcelain mortar and pestle, but they are more fragile.<br /><br />To clean, wipe with a damp cloth, that works to a certain extent, but I found that using glycerin U.S.P. (anhydrous) to clean the marble works better and it helps seal the marble and clean away the residue (essential oils) of the spices better.  Now, you used to be able to buy this at the pharmacy, but since all of this terrorism scare you can't find it over-the-counter and have to ask for it or you can order it from Amazon.  It only takes about 2 ml (one-half teaspoonful) to clean the mortar and pestle. After the cleaning with glycerin, I use a damp cloth to clean further. Among other uses glycerin is used for chafed, chapped, and cracked lips and windburned skin. So, it is safe to use, it is used as a sweetening agent, and makes the marble less porous and look better. Dimensions: 3-1/4"" diameter x 3"" tall bowl, 4"" pestle.<br /><br />I am pleased with this little kitchen aid and the aroma from the freshly ground spices it absolutely amazing and you can grind to the consistency that you need and you aren't beholden to what the manufacturers of spices believe to be the correct consistency.

The size of these are one size down from the largest bagged size and are very lightly salted, which I enjoy very much. The texture is not rock-hard like some other larger pretzels I've had; rather, when you bite into one of these, it has a flakey, slightly (but pleasantly) crumbly texture that is easy to chew. The flavor is mild and just plain good. I enjoy making chocolate covered pretzels once or twice a year during holidays for my family as well as bundle up packages of regular and white chocolate pretzels as treats to give away, and everyone enjoys them.

I had always used Similac in the past for my two first children but with the resent recall I decided to try something else for my third. My cousin had used Earth's Best Organic Formula for her baby and had been very happy with it so it was a brand I was familiar with. It also seemed only natural to go with an organic formula since the rest of our household drinks organic milk. I saw that Amazon had it on sale making it cheaper than other brands with the free shipping. This brings me to what I'm unhappy about...<br />Sadly my little guy gave up breast feeding rather abruptly forcing me to turn to bottle feeding. I tried pumping but he was plowing through my supple faster then I could produce it so I ordered this formula from Amazon. I signed up for their new amazon-mom program which allowed me to get free second day shipping (which was how fast I needed it). 3 days after ordering it I got an email (from amazon, not ups) saying the shipment had been delayed and it should arrive 3 days later ... over a week and a half later the package finally arrived. I was pretty upset because this forced me to go to our local store to by other formula which is very pricey since I live on an island. Amazon offered no apology or compensation for the extremely late package. Sadly this is not the first time I've run into this problem with Amazon not shipping things when they say they will, and items arriving far past when they ""guaranty"" they will. I think I've finally had enough though and learned my lesson not to order from Amazon if you want anything in a reasonable amount of time.

Interesting, my husband and son came up with different answers as to which tasted ""more like peanuts"", and my son (who is 14) misidentified which sample was from the brand he has been eating for years. Both found both peanut butters quite good and could not pick a favorite.<br /><br />I agree with my husband that Planters has a stronger ""peanut"" flavor, though I think that Skippy has a stronger flavor overall. I think Skippy has a far more powerful scent. In terms of texture, both were beautifully creamy. There may be a little bit more oil in the Planter's peanut butter, but it did not impact the flavor. The Skippy is higher in fat (and calories).<br /><br />This is definitely a product that I would buy, and my family (who have rejected other brands) have demonstrated that they will consume it happily.<br /><br />***<br />Edited on November 1 to add that it is a major annoyance that the design of the bottom makes it all but impossible to extract all of the product.

The taste is slightly strange --- and the ingredients tell why. The key ingredient isn't sweet potato, but RICE FLOUR! Sweet potato flakes (whatever those are) come second, then tapioca starch. Next comes oil (sunflower, safflower, or canola) then yellow corn flour.

Popped sorghum has a heavier, fuller taste than regular popcorn. Best of all, there are no kernel husks in the end result... just little fluffy popped sorghum. I experimented with popping different quantities and found that keeping the amount limited works best. With larger quantities, a significant number of the kernels did not pop.

Prior to Orijen I used Purina One. They loved it, but ate much more and were always extremely thirsty. The stool was huge!--no thanks to corn and other cheap grain fillers. With dry kibble, dogs and cats do drink more water as compared to eating canned or raw. But FRESH water is always there. I do include a few medallions of Natures Variety Raw every other day. I have seen improvement in coat, reduction in eye gunk and more energy. My cats have also shown no signs of hairballs. This company is no gimmick.

I grew up not far from Pontefract in Yorkshire where licorice was a treat for those who couldn't afford chocolate, so I love the black chewy Pomfret cakes and I like to chew real licorice roots. Black licorice is typically made with treacle or molasses, but this like American red licorice with a fruitier, less sweet flavor.<br /><br />On the plus side, it is good and chewy if you keep it in the fridge. To me, it tastes better than red licorice because it is not as sweet and has a delightful taste of pomegranate.<br /><br />On the minus side, I wish there were more licorice flavor. This might be a boon to those who don't like licorice, as I couldn't taste the licorice root extract.<br /><br />The main ingredients are organic wheat flour and organic sugar.  There's even a tiny bit of sunflower oil in the ingredients, above elderberry extract, citric acid, natural flavor (not sure what the flavor is?), pomegranate juice concentrate and last & least licorice root extract.<br /><br />This is an enjoyable candy, good for a hike where you need that little bit of extra sugar.  There are 130 calories in 5 pieces, the bag says it has 3.5 servings (I think there were nearer 4), but still that is 455 calories a bag.<br /><br />For me, I'd like less sweetening and more licorice to make this a truly great snack.

It was outstanding and the big hit of the Chrsitmas dinner this year. After letting it thaw for three days in the refrigerator and then setting it out on the counter for a couple hours to come up to room temperature, I set about making a simple rub of olive oil, salt, pepper, thyme, rosemary, and minced garlic. I then put it on a hot gas grill and seared it for about 2-3 minutes on each side. It then went into a preheated oven set to 250 degrees for 1 1/2 hours. That brought the internal temperature to about 140 degrees, a perfect medium rare in the middle and medium on the ends. It literally melted in your mouth and could be cut with a fork. My dinner guests said it was literally one of the finest tasting tenderloin roasts they had ever eaten. I wouldn't hesitate to purchase this from Omaha Steaks on Amazon again.

I just happened across this in the supermarket and thought I'd give it a try.  I generally don't eat much in the way of pasta, but since I often feel unwell, the convenience was appealing.  Other reviewers commented on the need to cook the noodles a bit longer than the directions call for and I think there may be something to that.  I ended up using the 14K BTU burner on my gas stove for a full 10 minutes and they came out great.  I think if I had used the regular 9K BTU burner and stuck to the required cooking time, the noodles may not have turned out so well.  You also need to stir the noodles within the first few minutes that they come to a boil or they will start sticking to each other and the bottom of the pot.<br /><br />I was a little apprehensive about how this dish would taste and I have to state that I really couldn't tell the difference between this product and the ""regular"" version.  I was never a huge fan of the Kraft  product because I prefer homemade to stuff out of the box. But allergy season is looming and I knew that I needed a variety of convenience foods on hand for the high-pollen count days that always make me too sick to prepare meals from scratch.  But as grateful as I am to find another gluten-free food that I actually enjoy and want to stock in my pantry, this is one that will have to be an occasional indulgence. Because even though it is gluten-free and its target market is more health conscious than average, this product is quite high in sodium.

If you want to change to this -- just be aware that anytime you change your cat's food, you have to do so very gradually over about a week's time, mixing the new with the old in gradually increasing amounts. Never just switch from one food to another, or you are asking for stomach upsets. The people who make this food actually recommend feeding a mix of dry kibbles with the canned food, which is how I feed it. I have three Manx cats that I have switched over to this food and they are doing extremely well. Their coats have improved and they have more energy. One of my boys has lost weight on their low-calorie formula and he looks great. My female has stopped scratching herself and her fur has grown back where she licked it off -- I think she had food allergy issues with her old food. My other boy has issues with struvites and was on a prescription diet from the vet. However, the manufacturer even said he couldn't stay on it forever without constant blood testing because it could harm his kidneys! Who wants to feed their cat something that could harm his kidneys?? So far, after several months on Wellness, he's doing great. Their food keeps the Ph of the urine low, which is great for a cat with his problems. So many of the store bought foods are literally full of garbage -- rejected stuff that would be thrown away. Meat by-products contain some pretty horrible stuff. Also, cats are carnivores and need meat -- not cereal, which is a main ingredient in many cat foods. When's the last time you saw a cat in the wild eating corn or meal? Wellness has human grade meat as its main ingredient and also contains healthy veggies.  My two boys are on the Lite formula and my girl is on Adult Super5 Mix. I'm glad a friend told me about it. Highly recommended.",0.9540798

Sorbitol, that nasty stuff in gum that gives people gas and loose stools! Can you wonder why your dog stinks up the house if it's eating this crap? And sugar! Need I even say why that is bad, or what health problems that can lead to? My vet sure got on a soapbox over the dangers of sugar, and rightly so. And even the ""healthy weight"" stuff has sugar and sorbitol in it!<br /><br />Don't buy Beneful for your dog. Pay careful attention to the entire ingredients list of the dog food you DO buy, as a lot of brands sure don't think you care about whether your dog lives many years or has expensive vet bills as long as it scarfs down their corner-cutting product. And if you must buy Beneful, at least send the company a few angry letters telling them to take the sugar and fake sweeteners out so you no longer have to feel you're killing your dog. I mean, come on, they could use apple juice if they wanted a sweetener. This is incredibly unhealthy and reprehensible, if you ask me. I sure won't buy this dog food ever again, and I would think twice before trusting Purina.",0.11857684

This variety pack arrived with 12 flavored coffee varieties, 12 ""regular"", 6 extra bold, 9 decaf and one Revv with Ginseng and Guarana.  There was one duplicate in our package- we had two Donut Shop coffee k cups.  That was the only duplicate.<br /><br />The packaging was not fancy but the coffee came well packed.  The k cups were in a 5x5x12 inch box which was packed inside a larger box for shipping.  All k cups were in good shape.  This was purchased in May 2012 and most k cups had expirations in November/December 2012 or January 2013.  One k cup was past it's best use by date by about a month.  There were 3 other k cups that had best use by dates that were within 2 weeks of purchase.<br /><br />All in all for getting close to 40 different varieties of coffee and compared to reviews for other sources of similar variety packs this was a good value for us. The vast majority of the k cups had best use by dates that were 6-8 months away with only 1 that was past date and only a couple that were short dates.

It is only recently I started to find some canned coffee-related goods (i.e. coffee ""drinks"") on the shelves in the mainstream supermarkets. Normally, real canned coffee come from Asian markets.<br /><br />When I saw this being offered on vine, it piqued my curiosity. How would it compare to Asian coffee? I had thought that perhaps an Asian company was trying to make its market in the states through the Internet, but I was wrong.<br /><br />Upon close inspection, I realized that it's made in Denmark but the Coca Cola company. Huh, Coke? Interesting.<br /><br />Amazon shipped the can in a bubbled mailing bag, those yellow kind. Pretty standard. However, the can did come with many dents. I don't know if it was already there before they sent it to me, or perhaps the mailing process caused those. I'm just the can was not broken when it got to me.<br /><br />It says ""do not shake"" on top of the can - very different from all the ""shake well"" notices in the Asian beverages. This leads me to wonder - perhaps it's not made with powdered coffee like most Asian beverages.<br /><br />I also see ""sugar"" in the ingredients instead of some artificial sweetener. To me, that is a plus.<br /><br />I'm used to drinking pretty sweet coffee in a can, and this was not so sweet. Yes, it's sweet, but it's not too bad, compared to the Asian coffee in a can I had grown used to. It is, however, not for anyone who is looking for black coffee. The can does say ""cappuccino."" It's somewhat bitter, a little bit acidic. I know some other reviewers said it's metallic in the taste, but I don't taste that much - perhaps I've been jaded by the Asian canned coffees?<br /><br />Overall, I give it a four stars for the taste.

I just peeled myself off the ceiling after drinking a cup of this. This might be better named ""Double Sugar"" Flavor Hot Chocolate mix.<br /><br />First, the good stuff. There is no doubt in my mind that Ghirardelli continues to make a distinctive, excellent quality chocolate. The cocoa used in this mix is smooth, dark, fruity and aromatic. Nothing else like it that I've ever tasted.<br /><br />Now, the criticism. There is just too much sugar in the mix. The recommended proportion of mix to 8 oz milk is four tablespoons. (By the by, there is no powdered milk in here. You must add your own milk--or soymilk or rice milk--great option for lactose-intolerant types.)<br /><br />People, you are using a quarter cup of mix at 4 Tbs and most of the mix seems to be granulated sugar, which you can taste and crunch in your mouth if you sample the dry mix. Cutting down fifty percent on the mix gave me an acceptable cup of cocoa but...it was no longer double chocolate and it had naturally a poorer mouth feel and aroma.<br /><br />Double Chocolate Mix is some of the best cocoa I WOULD have had, if Ghirardelli could see their way to making a lower sugar version, and please, no sugar substitute, which I don't like to use.<br /><br />Summary; great chocolate flavor, unsurpassed.

The bronze dyes leave a rougher surface which makes the pasta easier to handle wet, and the cheese and sauce cling better, so you get a firm easy to cut and serve lasagne. The flavor and quality of your dish will be noticed by everyone. There are ten packages in this case, but the pasta keeps well for two years or more, so that is not a problem at our house.

Originally I bought them because they are gentler on one's stomach.  After a few necessary surgeries last year I found that wheat products tended to make me feel bloated and uncomfortable if I ate too much of them.  Thus I tried to cut back on wheat.  Of course cookies are one of those things we feel guilty about anyhow.  Well I don't feel guilty eating these cookies!  They have no ingredients which cause an allergic reation such as refined sugars, dairly or wheat.  Also they are delicious.  My finace has been requesting them and he grew up on the all-american startch and potato diet!<br /><br />The reason for 4 stars:<br /><br />The only suggestion I have is that the packaging be improved.  By this I mean that each package has 2 servings but the serving is only half a cookie!  So one can gobble up too much at a time.  If they would make one-serving sizes that would be great.  It's easier to control calories, requires less mental calculation and is an honest way to report calories.  Also for children it's easier to say ""one"" cookie, then ""half"" a cookie.<br /><br />However I don't hold this too much against the company because this packaging is standard industry practise.  However I hope in future they will think about making a single-serving package or a same-size package that has 2 cookies.<br /><br />Otherwise they are fantastic for what they are meant to be...that is a cookie alternative for those of us with sensitive digestive systems, and perhaps a few loved ones with a sweet tooth.",0.98950094

So I ordered the M-Berry tablets in the hopes that they would enable me to consume things that are good for me and that will help in the detoxification process without feeling like I'm losing my mind and without wanting to eat everything in sight.<br /><br />I got my order today, was really hoping they would work, but was a little skeptical after reading some of the reviews, so I guess I was cautiously optimistic. I tried 1/2 a tablet, and a slice of lemon expecting it to , best case scenario taste ""sweet-ish"". Oh my gosh! The lemon tasted like a nice sweet lemonade, not ""sweet-ish""--sweet. I was blown away. So I tried it with my pomegranate/aloe vera juice mix--amazing! The final test was my MSM/C mix which tastes very sour (from the vitamin C) and very bitter (from the MSM). I plan to start my day with the M-Berry tabs because they enable me to get those supplemenatal drinks down effortlessly. My husband has never heard of the miracle fruit, so I decided to do the lemon taste test with him, without telling him why I had him dissolve this 1/2 tablet on his tongue between his 2 lemon samples (I cut it in front of him and had him eat a piece before and after just so he could see that I had not added anything to the fruit. He was amazed as well. Had no clue why such a thing could be valuable, but at least I know it wasn't the placebo effect for me. I usually have challenges drinking enough water. I added some lemon to a bottle of water it tasted like lemonade. I am really excited.<br /><br />Yes, the tablets are a little pricey as supplements go, but M-Berry's pricing is very competitive with other sellers out there, and now I know the quality is good, and I don't have to worry about perishability like I would with the actual fruit.<br /><br />I will continue to buy them until my plant starts to fruit, and probably even after that just because they are so portable.

The heat is similar to tobasco sauce as whell. If you like vineger based sauces you might like it, but it's not worth the price, plus shiping if you ask me. I probably would have given it a better rating if they hadn't lied about the heat. It's just nothing special, the sauce actually started turning black in my fridge, and I've on had it for a couple weeks. The taste got worse too, I have no clue why.

They do have an initial odd smell but once rinsed, they are fine. They don't require any cooking. I add them to almost any, already prepared carbohydrate. Yes, of course you could use them in place of pasta in the expected dishes but many of us largely gave up pasta years ago during the Atkins craze. 80) For those of us who don't eat pasta regularly, I would recommend integrating them into rice or whatever the carb. I'm personally reluctant to cut out carb calories completely; so mixing them to reduce my intake works best for me. Think of them as filler, which they are. Their consistency is sort of gelatinous but similar to al dente pasta (except that they don't stick to your teeth). Because of their consistency, I'm not sure I would add them to purees, unless using the puree like a sauce. For a low-calorie meal with this fettuccine variety, I like to prepare them with a Thai peanut sauce using PB2 and other healthier alternatives (e.g., apple sauce in place of oil, etc). I usually add spinach, and chicken to increase protein levels. I prefer this variety of miracle noodle - and sometimes cut the noodles to meet my needs - but they do have other shapes/cuts that might work better with a wider variety of recipes.

I live in the USA and people here don't eat toast unless it has some kind of sugary/corn-syrupy stuff on it. I hate the idea of eating toast with anything sweet except honey. So, I am out of choices in here....or so I thought. I discovered marmite because of one of my classmates who is from England. She likes it so much that she sleeps with a jar right next to her. If it were a man, she swears she'd have babies with it. Tempted by her passion, I went straight ahead to Wegmans (fyi best grocery store on planet earth) and bought a jar. I spread some butter on my toast and then a very(VERY) thin layer of marmite on top. The first bite did not leave a very pleasant taste in my mouth. However, a few bites later I was craving for more. It tastes like a mix of mushrooms(the non-magical kind), molasses, malt, tamarind, licorice, and jaggery. My friend on the other hand had to drink a whole can of juice(booze) to get rid of the taste in her mouth.<br /><br />Apparently, even in minute portions, it's very high in vitamin B12 and folic acid which is a good thing. The jar looks very British, with the no-frills label and the vintage yellow cap. I am going to use it for storing honey or spices when im done with the marmite. Dark glass jars keep spices fragrant longer.",0.9840151

Healthier than Aspartame and of course Saccharine. A much better alternative to the packets of ""Splenda"", because the packets contain maltodextrin or other fillers that add up to about 1g carbs per 2 packets. I like sweet beverages, so using packets really adds up after a while. The taste of sucralose is very *similar* to sugar-sweetened drinks, but there's still a little difference. It might be all in my head, and it's certainly not anything to worry about.<br /><br />One small negative I noticed is that I think they overestimate the sweetening power a little bit. I love the big $1 unsweetened teas from a very popular fast food franchise (just about the only thing I can get away with without guilt on their menu :P ), and I used to use 3 packs of Splenda in them to get a perfect amount of sweetness for me. According to this bottle, that should equal 6 drops of EZ-Sweetz, but it actually takes about 10 to give the same sweetness. Not really a big deal.<br /><br />I'm personally a big fan of Stevia, but it's a relatively under-researched food product. Sometimes synthetic products (Sucralose) are actually better in this regard because you tend to know exactly what it is and isn't. Stevia is all-natural and, while it tastes fantastic and has been used naturally for thousands of years in many parts of the world, I would prefer more modern scientific study on it before making a life commitment to it, especially if there's a better alternative currently out there.

Sugar, skim milk, molasses, etc.. even the preservative is plain old vitamin E.<br /><br />Next I was curious about the calorie/sugar/fat content as compared to my usual granola, Kashi Apple Orchard.  This product (same serving size) has 1 gram less of total fat (though saturated fat is 1 g more than the Kashi), 1 gram less of carbohydrates, and one less grab of protein.  Total calories are the same per serving.  Contrasting with the Kashi, I would never eat this for breakfast since my days of chocolate (Count Chocula) early in the morning are long since past.

I had to be put on pitocin (without meds for the first 14 hours) then I got the meds and then got the epidural about 45 minutes before I actually gave birth. Let me tell you, I only pushed for about 20 minutes and I was done. I attribute that 100% to the tea.

While my seven-year-old enjoyed every flavor very much, strawberry came out slightly ahead in taste.  This time when we received the strawberry-only pack he was thrilled to have a whole box of his favorite but still hoped for a bit of variety.  While he is an avid fan of the flavor of these fruit twists, I am a fan of the ingredients and am happy to serve them to him.  The wholesome ingredients of the Strawberry flavor are as follows: Organic Apple Puree, Organic Apple Juice Concentrate, Organic Flavors, Pectin, Colored with Fruit and Vegetable Juice.<br /><br />These fruit twists make a great alternative to the fruit snacks his friends seem to always get in their lunchbox but are a much healthier choice.  If my son is not able to finish his lunch (which seems to be the case most days with the school's 10-15 minute time allotment for lunch) after school during pick-up he will take the fruit twists out of his lunchbox and the other children beg him to trade with him.  Most times he refuses because he enjoys them so much.  I will be re-buying these and packing these in his lunch every once in awhile for a treat.  However, when ordering again I will probably choose the Variety Pack as you get a 24 pack for the same price as a single flavored 18 pack.<br /><br />My personal opinion of the product's flavor is that it is delicious but a bit too sour/tart/tangy.  I can't eat them on a regular basis but my child who loves sour/tart fruit and the occasional sour candy says it is perfect.  Additionally, the product does have a tendency to stick to the teeth.  My child's molars are sealed and he has never had a cavity so it is not an issue for our family but may be something to consider in your purchase.",0.99551123

For the record, I love the slightly-sour taste of Dunkin Donuts coffee and I find the stuff made by ""that other chain"" to be akin to re-hydrated cigarette ash.

Until you buy 80 of them and get tired of the flavor.  Then, my favorites were the Caribu's....but something happened to that brand (see reviews) and I agree, they did something...either they don't put as much in the cups or they changed the blend, the sourcing of the beans, etc......wasted money on Caribu and wont go back to the brand.<br /><br />So Wolfgang Puck got the nod, tried 4 different flavors.  This one, Sorrento, is not my favorite of the bunch (currently Colombian Chef's Reserve).  It has a bolder strength (which I believe hard core coffee drinkers would consider Medium), but to me it has a simple burnt flavor to it.  Cream and Sweetener don't correct for this, and thus I'm a bit disappointed....but again it was a stab in the dark.<br /><br />I think if you prefer a slightly bolder, slightly more burnt flavor in your coffee...this may be for you.  I like the character of the Colombian Chef's Reserve, but it is not as strong, and perhaps that is just what my taste is slanted towards.

Alu palak is great spooned over basmati rice or with Indian breads [or vegan whole wheat tortillas.] Can also be used as a base for a more elaborate mix of your favorite vegetables and/or beans. Tofu cubes are another delightful addition. I have also used it to make a delicious(!) spinach soup by adding Asian buckwheat noodles. Nicely spiced and not spicy by Indian standards. The spinach is a puree, partly a wonderful spinach gravy, accompanied by small diced potato cubes. A great choice for those who like or enjoy creating with spinach dishes. Made with spinach [palak], potatoes [aloo or alu], tomatoes, onions, water, sunflower oil, salt, cornstarch, ginger, garlic, sugar, chilies, turmeric, and spices. 200 calories and 6g protein per pouch.

If you want something that tastes like milk, drink goat's milk, because no brand of soy milk I have ever tried tastes like milk.  However, this organic vanilla soy milk sweetened only with evaporated cane juice is really delicious and very satisfying because of its high quality protein content with the complete amino acid profile.

I started researching different dog foods and consistently received the same brand recommendations: Innova, Canidae, Wellness, Chicken Soup for the Dog Lover's Soul...etc. I initially settled on Canidae, but also tried Wellness on a recommendation. The Wellness produced loose stools in two of my foster poodles, so I no longer use that brand. The Canidae, however, is perfect for my multi dog household, which often includes dogs ranging from puppyhood to senior status. The ingredients are phenomenal and, as all reviewers have said, the food contains no corn, wheat or soy, all common allergens in dogs. Although I also use and would recommend Innova Evo dry dog food, Canidae costs $35 for 40 pounds and Innova costs about $50 for a 28 pound bag. So, if you are budgeting a bit but would still like to give your dog the best, Canidae is great. After switching my dogs to Canidae, I noticed several things. First, my labrador retriever's coat sheen increased to the point of nearly blinding me in the sunglight; second, he lost about 10 pounds and developed greater muscle tone (although he was always fed recommended portions of commercial foods); third, my shedding dogs shed a lot less than in the past; and fourth, bad doggy breath is greatly reduced. I see no excuse not to switch your dog from a commercial food to Canidae or another super premium brand - it costs no more than a fancy bag of Iams or Science Diet, but can add quality years to your pets' lives! If you own a dog prone to allergies, such as a poodle, this food can't be beat. I had a family adopt a 5-pound malipoo from me and they emailed me to say they cannot feed him anything other than Canidae or he develops loose stools and needs to be taken out to the bathroom contantly. For your dog's sake switch their food; you can do a lot better than chain-store foods!",0.9884443

My mom fed it to her cats and they lived long, healthy lives. I just can't argue with the results.

I decided to give them Cosequin, a highly recommended supplement for joint health in cats and dogs.<br /><br />One of my cats is a pig and will eat anything that's not nailed down, so I knew giving him the supplement would be a fairly easy process; however, the other cat is very picky and will only eat dry food (he's not even interested in cat treats), so I was concerned that giving him the Cosequin would be an impossible task.<br /><br />Enter Greenies Pill Pockets (chicken flavored). Skittles (the finicky cat) went nuts the second I introduced them. I stuck a capsule inside a Pill Pocket and he snarfed it down at top speed, then started looking for more. And it's been that way ever since. For the first time ever, my cats actually look forward to getting their medication every day! (In fact, the other two cats who aren't receiving medication try to sneak a Pill Pocket every now and then.)<br /><br />The only thing I would caution is that the pockets are fairly small. Cosequin capsules, for example, can be opened and sprinkled on food or into a pocket -- but it took about three pockets to hold one capsule's worth of powder. Thus, I've had to keep the capsule intact, pushing it through the pocket so that it sticks out on both ends. That said, my cats still inhale it like it's the best thing they've ever tasted.<br /><br />Highly recommended for all cat families. This product works miracles.",0.9963758

Well, in this case at least, there is a difference.<br /><br />Both my wife and I tested this shampoo as well as its sister product, Total Care Volumizing Root Boost. We saw very little difference between these two products, but they both stand well above the typical shampoo. Coming out of the bottle they are both thick and creamy, and very little is needed to get a good lather going. When it comes time to rinse out, they wash off easily, leaving no residue. I was suspicious at first because my hair did not feel ""squeaky clean"" after rinsing, but once my hair was dry I could see that it was both clean and soft, not oily, and stayed that way all day, even wearing a hat. Both shampoos also give some weight to the hair which, with my thinning hair, I really appreciate. My wife also reported that with this shampoo, she felt no need to use conditioner. The reader will see essentially the same review on both of the Clear Scalp products we tested, the only difference between them being that other one (Volumizing Root Boost) probably leaves the hair with a little more weight.

Actually, I'm not sure that I'm prepared to wax rhapsodic about this cookie, but I did like it.  The combination of blueberries and brown sugar sounded wildly appealing to me right from the start.<br /><br />As is generally the case with tasting/testing something new, I invited a group of my co-workers down to my office to sample along with me.  The reactions were varied, but none were too negative.  Most of my co-workers were happy to try the Fruit Thins, but weren't planning to purchase them for themselves.  Some commented that they felt the cookies were, ""too sweet,"" but personally, I don't understand that.  These days, so many sugary, chocolaty treats taste overwhelmingly sweet to me.  I found this one to be just about right compared to more childlike cookies.  It's just the sort of nibble to enjoy with a mug of tea.<br /><br />Other co-workers commented on the cookie's texture, due primarily to the inclusion of wheat flour, oats, and flax seeds.  One compared it to a tastier teething biscuit, but having never tried one I'm not prepared to comment, LOL.  Personally, I like the inclusion of fiber and whole grains.  In fact, the entire ingredient list is reasonably healthy.  It's a treat I can feel good about eating.  And I especially enjoyed the subtle crunch of the flax seeds.<br /><br />As for me, I liked the flavor a lot.  You can see the crushed berries in the batter and you really get the blueberry taste.  Oh, and I've had the semi-resealable bag open on my desk for a week now.  The cookies taste as fresh and as crisp as they did on the first day.  That's impressive.  Not only would I buy these cookies again, I'm looking forward to trying other flavors.",0.99332875

It is so much easier to scoop and doesn't turn into the sticky mud that Tidy Cat would form.  I can actually scoop now and not have to empty the entire litter box.<br /><br />Both Fresh Step and Tidy Cat controlled odor.  Tidy Cat's plastic container was a bit easier to transport.

It's sort of like the epiphany you have when you think American cheese is the best cheese you've ever had until you actually try smoked gouda. I know that sounds like an overstatement, but that's how good Herr's Heinz-flavored ketchup chips are. Once you try these, all of your previous favorites will start to pale in comparison.<br /><br />""What's so darned great about them?"" you are probably wondering. What's gotten everyone in such a tizzy? Why the rave reviews and the almost cult-like devotion to these chips? It's not just because they taste good. It's because Herr's is one of the few snack makers that bucks that shady practice so many of them engage in now, especially Pringles. You know what I mean-- that cute, little trick of advertising their chips as literally bursting with flavor, when in reality the chips are so lightly dusted that there's barely any flavor to them. Herr's philosophy in terms of chip-to-flavor ratio couldn't be more different. Open any one of their snacks-- especially this one-- and the chips are so covered in powder that it's impossible to not have it cake up on your finger tips without constantly cleaning them. These Heinz ketchup flavored chips are so heavily dusted, in fact, that you'll wind up with red-stained fingers for a few hours after gorging on them. It makes for a messy experience but in the end, getting a moutful of flavor with each bite makes the hassle of cleaning up all worthwhile!<br /><br />Sure, this excessive powder doesn't exactly make Herr's the healthiest of snack choices, but what snack is? It's all gonna kill us, anyway, so really-- all this really comes down to is choosing our poison. My poison happens to be these chips, and will most likely be yours once you taste them and subsequently become hopelessly addicted like me.",0.46891657

I'm happy to say that I discovered the flavour the best in an iced tea with no milk OR sugar! That was super surprising to me! I usually add sugar to make the matcha sweet like the flavours usually are in their original forms, but this one came out the BEST unsweetened. Who would have thunk?<br /><br />I keep seeing online a ""recipe"" for iced matcha, or rather, instructions where all you have to do is add the powder to a bottle of water and shake like crazy! Well, I have tried that multiple times and it's gross every time haha. I uncap a bottle, sip a bit, shake some matcha in and shake away (for a loooong time) - but all I end up with is murky green water with clumps. Clumps that hit your teeth and dissolve into a bitter mess in your mouth.<br />THEN I read on a website (of course I can't remember which one) where they added just a half a teaspoon of matcha, and a tiny bit of cold water - the same way you would make hot matcha - to make a matcha paste first and then add more water! So I added my half tablespoon of English Toffee Matcha, about a teaspoon of water - and my shaking was vigorous! It created a smooth paste almost instantly with no lumps (I didn't even need to sift), I filled up my water bottle with the rest of the cold, filtered water. The liquid was emerald green, not lumpy or murky, and tasty! I didn't add sugar or anything else, just sipped away and lo and behold - English toffee flavour and natural sweetness from the matcha, with a bit of vegetal tones and no astringency.<br /><br />I'm pretty happy that I figured out the right way to make iced matcha in a bottle - I'm also happy with my English Toffee matcha.

Here is my experience:<br /><br />Having long wavy hair, I first experimented with ""<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007RTR8UW"">CLEAR Strong Lengths Conditioner</a>"" (paired with the moisturizing shampoo). After a week of use, my hair was surprisingly weighty. It appears that the product had been causing unwanted build-up. So, I used a different brand of shampoo/conditioner for a few days and then switched to this conditioner (with the same moisturizing shampoo). The results were greatly improved. My hair was bouncier and still shiny. So, the lesson here is that you might need to find the perfect combination of CLEAR products for your hair.<br /><br />Other notes:<br />I really like the ""upside-down"" design of the bottle (it helps prevent that awkward ""vigorously shaking the bottle in the dangerously slippery shower"" moment). Likewise, I enjoy the pleasant scent (but, those who are sensitive to perfumes may this product overwhelming). However, if you have long hair like me and are considering the ""Strong Lengths"" conditioner, you should know that this ""Moisturizing"" one is best for non-processed/non color-treated hair. (If you have longer, processed hair, then ""Strong Lengths"" is probably a good bet. It is thicker and coats damaged hair).",0.87990105

The lemongrass was picked in Thailand (lemongrass is widely used in Thailand for many cooking recipes). I order any product from The Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf online since there are no Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf stores near where I live. If you want to try other excellent teas from The Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf, try these two Limited Edition teas sold directly from The Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf's website, Spring Peach Oolong and Blueberry Peach Green Tea. The Spring Peach Oolong was grown 5,000 feet above sea level in the mountains of Thailand and the Blueberry Peach Green Tea was grown 1,200 meters above sea level in the Mae Salong region of Thailand. Besides the three teas I've mentioned from The Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf, I also highly recommend their special Dutch Chocolate Powder, Vanilla Caramel flavored coffee, Raspberry Cream flavored coffee, and Limited Edition Blueberry Streusel flavored coffee. In summary, this is a great chamomile tea. Another great chamomile tea to try is Fairmont Egyptian Chamomile. I was introduced to the Fairmont Egyptian Chamomile tea in 2010 when my sister and I dined at the Fairmont Dallas Hotel's Pyramid restaurant (a restaurant with a fresh market concept and with the largest hotel/restaurant herb and vegetable garden in the Dallas region). I visited the Fairmont Dallas Hotel's gift shop and they had an excellent array of organic teas with their Egyptian Chamomile being one of them. The Egyptian Chamomile has a nice sweet taste and it's sold on fairmontstore.com in their online gift store, the tea section. I strongly recommend the Fairmont's Organic Hawaiian Kei Lani Orange Pineapple, Organic Chinese Jasmine Butterfly #1, and Organic U.S.A.'S Cascade Peppermint teas. Anyways, I'm glad that this Lemon Chamomile tea from The Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf is available for purchase on Amazon. I think it's a great economical deal to purchase this from Amazon - you get a pack of three containers (each containing 20 tea bags). I have one container at home, one at my workplace, and I gave one container to my sister. I'm satisfied with this purchase.",0.99477524

I realize this isn't the highest quality cat food out there. However, in my opinion, this is a great middle of the road more natural cat food. Our cats love it and haven't had any problems digesting it.<br /><br />We have 2 cats that are a year old. We adopted them from a shelter 4 months ago. When they were babies they got a virus and as a result have sensitive stomachs. I had to find a food for them with not a lot of fillers and dyes. Particularly the red dye found in most cat foods. The foster home gave them Purina Naturals which was more expensive then Goodlife so I am very happy I found this brand of food. I am a realistic common sense cat owner on a budget so price had to be a factor especially with 2 cats. I admit I didn't know anything about corn and other stuff in cat food. The ingredients in this cat food hasn't had any negative affects on our cats. In fact they have a soft shiny coat, very seldom get hair balls, and are full of energy.<br /><br />I always had cats growing up that ate just regular cat food and they lived to be old. In fact my one cat is 13 years old now. I don't understand why all of a sudden people are so critical of cat food. There are certainly worse cat foods out there with a lot of fillers and dyes that in some cases can be more expensive.

It's pretty durable. You hide the treats in the cups and your pup has to find them. I think the best part about this game is that it is 3 games in 1. Some of the games were easier for him to understand how to play quicker than others. My puppy was able to learn all 3 of the games pretty quickly. The instructions and set up are simple. I wish there were more of the green cups though. One more note i got mine from CVS for 13$ and change...but that was the first time i have seen a dog game sold in mainstream stores so buying online form amazon might be a good option if you dont feel like store hopping to try to find it.

The small round kibble size also fits perfectly into the treat balls I have and they love to roll those around in the basement at night. I usually mix it with a high fiber calorie-reduced food because it is very rich and my oldest needs some more fiber in his diet to prevent constipation issues. I've learned the hard way that feeding him only grain-free food will cause him to gain weight and become constipated. This brand works better than others though and they all do very well on the mix. I would not recommend feeding exclusively dry food though, but if you do feed some then this one seems like a good choice to try.<br /><br />One thing to note is that even though it claims to be Roasted Venison & Smoked Salmon, it actually is chicken-based and contains fish meal and some plant proteins.

I kept thinking that I should try it, but I have been so consistently disappointed with gluten free bread products that I wasn't terribly excited about it.  The elimination diet must have driven me to desperation because I bought  box last week.<br /><br />The baking instructions called for the addition of oil, shredded cheese (which I omitted), eggs, and water or milk.  Very simple.<br /><br />My favorite egg replacer for baking is banana, but I somehow thought  the banana flavor wouldn't work so well with focaccia.  I used flax gel instead.  I used rice milk for the liquid, kneaded, and pressed my dough into the pan.  It smelled so incredibly while it was baking that I didn't think I could wait until it was finished.  As a matter of fact, I didn't.  When it was mostly done I pulled it out the oven (after telling myself that it should be baked through and I just needed to test it), cut a piece, and placed it on a plate with a little olive oil.  Oh my!  It was fantastic.  Slightly underdone, but fantastic.  It went back into the oven sans the piece I already inhaled.<br /><br />I can't describe how delicious it is.  I can't even say that it tastes like ""real"" focaccia bread because I haven't had such a thing in years.  What I can tell you is that it is the best gluten-free bread experience I have ever had.

I moved to the Florida keys about 10 years ago and found the local stores only carried instant grits or white corn grits.<br />Recently I just couldn't stand it anymore and went searching for yellow corn grits! I was lucky enough to run across<br />Bob's corn grits and ordered some right away. They arrived 2 days ahead of schedule and I could hardly wait for breakfast this morning to have some. Well; I'm here to tell your these are the absolutely the finest grits I have ever had, and I've eaten a lot! I don't know what kind of corn is used, or how it is processed but they cook to the perfect consistancy in about 6 minutes and when you consider even the instant kind take 2 minutes in the micro It is well worth waiting that little extra time! I don't know how you can go wrong with this man's product.<br />Mike Williams<br />Key Largo, Florida",0.9980299

I really like it.  It has a different taste, hard to describe.  It is smooth, with a very light touch of zing (the ginger) and a light fruit taste.  It is blended and packaged by Stash, so, if you are a tea-lover, you know it's good.  Stash makes a great full-bodied tea.  This one is a caffeine-free herbal tea.<br /><br />The ingredient blend is: hibiscus flowers, orange peel, ginger, chicory, damiana, peppermint, and natural dragonfruit flavor.<br /><br />This tea is labeled as ""2nd Chakra,"" so it is intended for the Sacral Chakra (the one that has to do with sexuality).  According to the envelope, the damiana herb is said to enhance male and female sexuality, so there is the connection.<br /><br />For my metaphysical friends:  if this tea is also made with the ""intention"" of opening or stimulating the 2nd chakra (which I assume it is), that will be an added benefit.  The chakra teas are new and I have noticed they make one for each of the 7 major chakras.  I will be trying them all.<br /><br />(Note: I participated in a group meditation the other night and had combined a 2nd Chakra plus a 6th Chakra tea bag and drank the tea before and after.

Since it is darkly roasted it doesn't have a lot of subtle tones to it like lighter roasts have. It has the twang that this level of roast imparts on coffee and, of course, a strong coffee flavor.

I am so glad I did!  I was expecting a stew like another reviewer said, and I guess you could refer to it that way.  When I opened the first can that is what I was expecting to see, but instead it is a course pate with chunks of veges in it. Kind of like a toddler food.  Cats are tricky to please for sure, but mine loved everything about this food.  They not only ate the chunks of veges, but licked their bowls clean.  I love the fact that it was such a hit, and will continue to buy it for them.  I also love that is like something you would make for them at home, only with all the right vitamins and minerals added.  Very user friendly.  My 3rd cat cannot eat poultry, so until Halo makes one without chicken in it, she will be fine with her Nature's variety instinct rabbit and Tiki foods.<br />UPDATE - 11-16-2011  My cat has been eating this now for a little while and she always seems hungry when she gets this!  I don't think I will be buying more for her.  I do think it is a good food and probably perfect for cats that need the lower protein, but mine need less moisture in the food and more meat.  I always add about a tablespoon of water on their canned food anyway.  Cost wise, this is about the same as Natures Variety, Natures Logic and even Addiction which are wonderful foods.  I like it better when I add the moisture and am paying for meat in their food.",0.99463946

I am not usually a fan of Stash's teas, but this premium tea is as good as much more expensive and higher-end teas. Please make sure you get the ORGANIC GREEN tea version, as it is a different tea (albeit with caffeine) and far superior to Stash's regular lemon ginger herbal tea, in my opinion.<br /><br />Everything in this tea is organic---the organic ginger, the organic green tea, and the organic lemongrass. Although it does contain caffeine, I think it is a much milder green tea, because I tasted the ginger and lemongrass dramatically more than the green tea. This balance made the tea even more enjoyable---a sort of different kind of teasan, one balanced with a little green tea.<br /><br />Stash Tea had their 35th anniversary last month, so they've been around a while, and I love the direction they are moving with their teas, towards more organic and loose teas, more true flavors instead of artificial flavorings.<br /><br />I would highly recommend Stash's Organic Premium Lemon Ginger Green Tea unless you do not care for ginger or for spicier teas; otherwise you are certain to be delighted!<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br />*****",0.9918091

Wang,1,1,5,1265500800,Crunchy Tasty Light Snack!,"Yesterday my friend shared with me a bag of this Pom-Raspberry snack from his 12-pack box. The bite-sized crunch is lightly sweet and delicious.  I was instantly hooked and got online to do a lot of research because I had a serious doubt about food products made in China. I really hoped this product would have a clean bill of health so I would feel comfortable buying it regularly.<br /><br />I should say that Mrs. May's website erased a big part of my concerns. First of all, most ingredients were grown in US and Canada. Only three ingredients are sourced from China (rice malt, sesame seeds, and sea salt).  This is important because chemical contamination of China's natural resources is so serious that I won't want to eat a lot of food products grown there without endorsement from very reliable inspection agencies. The company seems to have done a lot of work to make sure the manufacturing process would be safe from microbiological hazard as well.  They also use two 3rd party international inspection agencies.  That being said, I've learned from multiple sources that Chinese factories are known for staging for health inspections. So I cannot just rely on the company's own words.  However, what makes me more convinced is that Whole Foods is one of their buyers.  I think this is an important endorsement for the product.  It makes me feel a lot more comfortable about making the purchase myself.  With the overall food safety concerns removed, I will give this product 4.5 stars.<br /><br />A good reference is Mrs. May's website FAQ on general production.  Since Amazon does not allow pasting of the link here, you can just google the website and check it out.",0.6933537

I like a STRONG cup of coffee. I use K-cups at work because we have no facility for rinsing/cleaning/getting water for a regular machine.<br /><br />Sumatran coffees generally have a very rich, earthy taste; some would describe it as being ""tangy"" almost. Having tried the two other main brands of Sumatran for K-cups, the Puck is by far the best. It is not as bold as something you would get from Starbucks or from roasting yourself, but it has all the flavor elements of a good Sumatran cup. It especially has that nice earthy taste. Even the aftertaste is rich.<br /><br />IMPORTANT: If you are looking for a k-cup that you will use on any other than the smallest cup setting, this coffee is not for you. In my opinion you get a Sumatran because you love strong coffee. Watered down it loses its distinctiveness. Get a generic french roast if you want weaker coffee with some flavor. I make mine with 2 k-cups, at the smallest setting. By camparison, I would give a Starbucks Sumatra mandheling a 10/10 rating for boldness. The Puck is about an 8, the Diedrich is a 4.<br />I highly recommend this coffee for bold coffee lovers, provided you use the smallest cup setting. You will not be disappointed. Best K-cup I have had yet, and I have tried many- Newman, Timothy's, Donut Shop, Diedrich, etc.<br /><br />Addendum: I have since tried th Green Mountain Sumatran, and gave that a one -star. Stale and bitter. I will definitely stay with Puck's.",0.98824096

It warns that the tea takes some time to dissolve, and it did- about a minute of stirring before it was fully dissolved. It was easy to mix with a bottle you can shake, but it does eventually dissolve. The tea itself is fairly sweet, but still nice and tart enough for me. I preferred to water it down even more than the box suggested and put one pouch into a 20oz. bottle which made it more palatable for me. However, if you prefer your drinks more on the sweet side, I would follow the directions as stated.  There is about 20 mg of caffeine per pouch as well and 10 calories per packet.

That product let me tell you is the best thing since slice bread. I am big on Monster Absolute Zero, and if that is not available Monster Low Carb. So when I dropped by the Vitamin Shop a few days ago and the salesman who most certainly knows what he is talking about, dudes rock solid, suggested I try Celsius. Handed me 4 cans of this flavor, ""Sparkling Orange"". Upon initial taste results, it reminds me of Soda. I have not drank soda in upwards of 2 years. This brought all those couch potato memories back, till I rotated the can and read the ingredients. That quickly made the lazy days disappear once more. This drink is loaded with the energy stuff you will expect from a drink such as monster, BUT with a change of pace in taste. It does not taste anything like a redbull or monster or even rockstar, this unique taste separates it from all the energy boosters I've tasted in the passed. Long story short, this does pack a kick. Today is a perfect example, I worked a full shift on 8 hours of sleep, 8am-4pm, worked out at the gym from 9pm-11pm, slept 2 hours, and got up to go into work at 4am, pickup a few hours of overtime, drank a can and I am feeling GREAT. The energy boost is enlightening. So if you are looking for a good energy booster at a better price than most, this is it for you. I love Monster Absolute zero, but it is more than twice the price per can.",0.9989767

It deserves the highest praise, and I feel compelled to be the one to give it.<br /><br />First, it must be understood that this is a true delicacy and thus it is to be sipped and savored slowly, not gulped down indiscriminately like a can of coke. If you really want to get the most out of this true little slice of heaven, you have to address it unhurriedly , preferably with your eyes closed. It is best served refrigerated and I like to drink it straight out of the can, because even the can feels good, with its slim line and nice heft. It's actually quite a bit heavier than one expects... So, can or glass, take a sip and gently roll it around on your tongue, like you would a fine wine. Feel the thick richness of the nectar, dancing its dance of subtle, rich flavors in the hiddenmost recesses of your taste glands. Remember to breath gently through your mouth and nose too, to get the full effect of the subtle hues of this amazing fruit's aromas. Notice the tiniest little hint of bitterness - it really rounds out the ""feel"" of the mango. It no doubt comes from the pulp and, without it, this juice would not be nearly as delectable as it is.<br /><br />Does this sound like poetry to you? Perhaps it seems like it is a somewhat overdone description of a product that is, after all, ""only a fruit juice"", right? Well, I invite you to try it yourself and see if it is not deserving of every accolade I have ascribed to it and many others I may have missed.<br /><br />I am having one now and I must add, though it is probably fairly obvious, I feel it enhances my imagination and my creativity too... :)",0.9768629

This Green Tea is a blend of Japanese Green Teas, which are more robust and flavourful than typical Chinese Greens. The only Green Tea I've tasted that compares is straight Yama Moto Yama from Japan. I believe Yama Moto Yama is also in the Stash blend.<br /><br />As far as Green Teas go, this blend is among the naturally sweetest and has no bitterness... unless you overcook it. The trick I have found to getting the best flavour from Green Teas is not using too high a temperature to steep it. Steep at a lower temp (170F-180F) for a longer time which will result in a tea that is actually green in colour, not brown or gold. Also, this tea tastes best as is, don't put any sweeteners in it like sugar or honey. If you are addicted to sugar, ween yourself off of it and enjoy the great flavour of this premier Green Tea.<br /><br />Of course, Green Tea is incredibly healthy, rich in anti-oxidants and relaxing theanine, is not harmfully acidic like coffee and there is also one quarter the amount of caffiene than in coffee - easier to brew too!<br /><br />The price is quite reasonable considering the quality of tea you are getting. Better yet, buy it in bulk for great savings.<br /><br />If you want to be even healthier, Stash also sells their Premium Green Tea in organic form for only a few more pennies per bag.<br /><br />Enjoy and be healthy!",0.99840784

So when I saw Tabasco Slim Jims, being a fan of Slim Jims anyway, I had to try them. The smaller sized ones, which I have been unable to find here on Amazon, taste great, but they are somewhat tougher than the larger versions, though not in a bad way. The medium sized and large ones, which this review is about, are much softer. Regardless, they are ALL delicious. They have the same spicy flavor that we Tabasco lovers have come to crave, but at the same time, since it was mixed in with other ingredients, it isn't so hot that you are forced to stop eating no matter how good it tastes. My friends and I all agree that it does have a high heat factor to it, and people who don't like spicy stuff might find it too much. But if you like spicy foods, these are an AMAZING snack. If you haven't tried them, then I highly recommend you get one from your grocery or convenient store. If you like them, buy them here since they are cheaper in bulk. Fans of Tabasco will not be disappointed. That's my $.02 on the matter folks.<br /><br />  Thanks you so much for your time folks.<br />  Sincerely, R.A. McDowell",0.99312115

Pingshui tea market records date as far back as the Tang Dynasty (AD 618 - 907). The area's gunpowder tea was an important tribute traditionally given to the Chinese emperors; and with the growing trade volume between China and the West it also acquired an increasing number of lovers in Europe. Particularly during the second half of the 19th century, when gunpowder tea export reached its peak, its price on the London market was second only to then-popular Wu Yi Oolong (also from China). Even today, Zhejiang Province still proudly calls itself ""home of silk and tea"" for its two primary natural products.<br /><br />The name ""gunpowder"" derives from the tea's elaborate method of processing, which traditionally lasts several hours and during which the tea leaves are withered, steamed or stir-fried and individually rolled into small pellets. Early foreign traders mistook these pellets for gunpowder or gunshot.<br /><br />Gunpowder tea has a delicate aroma with a slightly smokey note. It should *always* be enjoyed without milk or cream.",0.9592226

The herbs had one failure (the cilantro) and the lettuce grew like gangbusters but didn't seem worth the trouble. Then I planted the French herb garden, wanting to have chervil and savory, among other herbs not commonly available at the grocery.<br /><br />The kit has chervil, sorrel, savory, parsley, Marseilles basil, sage and chives. All of these are quite useful. I might have substituted thyme for the parsley--parsley grows pretty slowly and I think it is a waste in the Aerogarden as it's commonly available in huge bunches at the market. But it is convenient to have this essential herb at your fingertips. Sad to say, one can't have rosemary or tarragon in the Aerogarden. Both of these are woody herbs and don't really grow from seeds. But one can often find pots in the garden center. Maybe with an additional grow-light, I can add them to the kitchen garden. I wonder if the Aerogarden pods could someday be adapted to grow slips of plants like tarragon (shipped live.)<br /><br />All the pods germinated before the estimated time, including chervil which has the longest (3 week) germination. The herbs are growing healthily and quickly. So far, this looks to be the most versatile of the sets I've grown. My previous herb garden resides in a flower pot and is more or less humming along--the basils and mint and chives are doing quite well in soil rather than hydroponics, though they were sulky when transplanted. I may keep this French garden growing indefinitely unless something more interesting crops up.",0.9911918

Especially since O's are so beloved by and wonderful for (developmentally) toddlers, who may grow to love them young, and keep them as a staple in their diet for years, perhaps for a lifetime. The opportunity for a company here is strengthened further by the huge market of devoted parents of young children who will seek out the healthiest version of O shaped cereal that their children will eat and enjoy... and will even pay a bit more for the higher quality.

So, when we found this item through an independent seller, we jumped on the opportunity and ordered a jar.<br /><br />Since the mustard is from Germany, the expiration dates in America run a little more quickly -- about two/two & half months.  However, that shouldn't be a problem because the mustard is so incredibly delicious that most people will find themselves running out of the product before it expires.  It is great on everything...  Meats and cheeses, breads, pretzels and you-name-it.  It is hot, but my girlfriend loves it and she never loves hot/spicy food or condiments.  But, I can't say that ""it's hot, but not too hot,"" because that's not doing the mustard its proper favor.  The flavor is piquantly zesty and has a good lasting combination with food.<br /><br />If you are having a party with kielbasa, bratwurst, sausage and such, do yourself a favor and be prepared with Lowensenf.

I did not cook it for several months but finally got around to it. I found the mix to be easy to prepare and the results were very good. I was concerned that the results might be too smooth (for the lack of a better description). Actually, the results are porous. This is good since it allows for the mix to absorb butter or syrup, etc easily. I cooked the single package (7 ounce) in a 5x9 inch pan. This worked out good and the end result was a loaf about 1-1/2 inches high. The bottom was beginning to brown and should not have been cooked longer. I ended up cooking the mix 20 minutes and the results were perfect. I did not eat all of the mix the first day. The next day I cut the cornbread into one inch squares. Then, I put butter on the squares and warmed them about 18 seconds in the microwave. I enjoyed them with cheese on the side and put a bit of syrup on the squares of cornbread. It was really a treat and tasted more like a desert than just a serving of cornbread. Also, I did not use regular sweet milk. I use undiluted Carnation Evaporated Milk. I wondered how this might work (since I did not dilute the milk) but found it to work very well. I recommend this product.<br /><br />Next time I'll cook two packages at one time and I plan to use a 9x9 inch pan to keep the end results being about 1-1/2 inches thick.

I buy 12 boxes at a time to save on shipping.  For many years I used to drink coffee from morning till night.  But finally I realized that drinking so much coffee was not healthy for me.  I finally resolved to improve my health and stopped drinking coffee all together.  I tried many alternative drinks to replace my coffee habit.  I found that green tea was not only good tasting it also has health benefits.  Green tea is one of the few drinks that actually makes you healthier (coffe and other drinks do not) - the only healthier drink is quality cold water.  In my opinion, for the price, Royal King 100% Natural Organic Green Tea is one of the best tasting teas.  This green tea has a beautiful golden color, the taste is bright and fresh.  I recommend adding a tiny amount of Y.S. Organic Bee Farms RAW HONEY to the tea to add sweetness and health benefits too.  I also give myself a treat once in a while by having a much more expense tea (Tribute Xi Hu Long Jing) but this fantastic tea is not practical for me to drink as my every day tea (although I would if I could afford it).<br /><br />Cons:  On my latest shipment the package shown on the Amazon page is different than the one shipped.  The one shipped displays ""NATURALLY HIGH IN POLYPHENOL CATECHINS"" (a key contributive element to the possible health effects of tea), whereas the Amazon package displays ""CAFFENE FREE"".

While not a connoisseur's tea by any means, it makes a good, strong, ""cuppa char"" to go with your breakfast, sammie, or cookies. I prefer the large pyramidal bags over regular bags, too, as they seem to improve brewing of the tea and are easier to fish out before pouring. The price here at Amazon is much, much better than at the stores, too--about 1/2 the typical grocery store price per bag!<br /><br />It does help if you know how to make tea, as making it incorrectly may result in a bitter, unpleasant brew. The key things to remember are: always prewarm your pot, use BOILING water (not just hot), and let it steep at least 3 minutes. As these are a bit larger than some teabags, I usually allow about 1-2 bags for each 2 cups or 1 mug of tea, plus an extra bag, ""for the pot"" so to speak. So in our 4-cup teapot, I will use about 4-5 bags, depending on how strong I want it. Milk (better than cream) will help cut the tannin, if your tea is too potent; lemon helps as well--but don't use milk and lemon together! ;)",0.9985685

And while my four-pawed trio generally took the move in stride and quickly adapted to their new home in a manner that filled me with new love and admiration for them, there is one item now, several years later, still sorely lacking in their lives: Pounce Tuna Treats! For as long as we've been together (and in the case of the two females, that means their entire life), there has never been a better way to reward them or just show them my affection than by giving them some of these - my cats loved them, and I knew that due to the treats' many healthy ingredients I was actually doing something good for my kitties in addition to making them happy. But Pounce is nowhere to be found on the shelves of German stores! My cats are not overly picky in their food choices; they willingly accept almost everything appearing in their food bowls. But they have made it quite clear to me that a decent substitute for Pounce is yet to be discovered. In the meantime, what's a poor cat owner to do???",0.982144

There's just something about them that reminds me of being a ""kid"" (hey, I'm still a kid!) and they just fill me with comfort!  Unfortunately for me, I'm also a very disciplined eater -- what my mom likes to call ""a health nut"" -- and there's usually not much room in my diet for a heaping big bowl of Honey Nut Cheerios.  Darn it!<br /><br />After doing some research on ""healthy cereals"" I decided to give the Cascadian Farms Honey Nut O's a try.  I didn't have particularly high hopes for the taste before I cracked open the box.  After all, how can you expect a healthy alternative to compete with your all-time favorite cereal? But, surprisingly the Honey Nut O's are a very light and delightful snack.  I ate them dry and with a bit of skim milk and I must say I prefer them dry.  They are a bit smaller than Honey Nut Cheerios and not nearly as resilient when it comes to soaking up the milk (i.e. they go soggy really fast!).  As other reviewers have mentioned, they are not nearly as sweet as Honey Nut Cheerios, however, they have a very authentic and light honey flavor.  In other words, they taste more ""real"".  The grain texture is also very nice and has a satisfying crunch while still being soft. (I hate cereals that rough up the inside of your mouth).<br /><br />All things considered, I definitely recommend the Cascadian version of my all-time favorite.  While I don't get the same warm cozy comfort as the Honey Nut Cheerios, I do enjoy them as healthy small-portion snack.  A small container of this cereal definitely beats eating pre-processed cereal bars or something similar which is filled with fat and soy ingredients.<br /><br />For those of you who are looking for something to sate your Honey Nut Cheerio craving, you'll probably want to pass on these and just go for the real deal :)",0.98464805

I compared the water test results provided by Essentia on their Web site and those of my local water authority.<br /><br />Essentia says, ""Electrolytes are dissolved minerals in the body that conduct electricity, such as calcium, magnesium, sodium and potassium. We add trace amounts of those same elements in a formula that complements the body's naturally occurring mix and concentration."" They must be really trace amounts. Reading their water test report, neither calcium or potassium are listed, and only .68 mg/l of magnesium. The sodium level is about the same as in my tap water. Certainly not the electrolyte levels of Gatorade.<br /><br />I can find nothing in my research that indicates a pH of 9.5 is anything special.<br /><br />Bottom Line: I'm not impressed.

Being a big-time green tea enthusiast, I decided to try Green Tea Leaves Cat Litter even though it was pricier and had to be shipped (not available locally).  I am totally pleased and impressed.  First, the litter is totally flushable which saves me many trips to the dumpster (we don't have our own garbage cans where I live) and that was a job I hated with a passion - especially during rainy weather.  Secondly, this litter never smells except for the nice odor from the components its made out of.  Third, my cats really like it!  Yes, it does track but no more than all the others - it's a nuisance but I guess it goes with owning cats and at least it's clean, not messy and dirty like some others I tried.  And fourth, a bag goes such a long ways that it's really not as expensive as it seems - actually I've found it to be way less expensive - and the bags are so light that I can handle them easily.  All in all I'm a happy camper now that I've found this litter - will never change (unless I can get the girls trained to use the real toilet {grin}!  By the way, my first order was from another source and I was horrified at the shipping charges -  Amazon offers free shipping on orders over $25 and this item qualifies so buy a couple of bags at a time and the price here is much better than anywhere else.",0.97195476

What you'll find is that even the supposed ""high-end"" lines from basically every major supermarket label are horrible for your fuzzy friends.

It's a tragedy, as these same cats end up with shorter lifespans, kidney problems, UTIs, cancer, and a host of other issues, all of which could have been avoided by a high quality food.<br /><br />This is an A-Grade food. What you'll find here is very high protein content, many meats high on the list, flaxseed, good vitamins and antioxidants, and no grains, which is great as a cat is not an omnivore, it's a carnivore, and it simply does not need grains.<br /><br />What you will NOT find here is the kind of junk you'll see in things like Purina One and Science Diet - byproducts (aka beaks, feathers, bird feet), brewers rice (aka the waste product from making beer), wheat flour (a leading cause of pet allergies), corn gluten (a cheap waste of space), and things like ""liver flavor"" (because they don't want to pay for the real thing).

We tried a mid level food (3 stars from Dog Food Reviews) and it did ok, but it was too high in protein for the giant breeds.  When we decided to get a Great Dane this spring I started looking for a food that would be good for both dogs and found this.  We tried it out and after the initial adjustment (necessary with any food) both seem to be doing well on it.  With a giant breed and a large mutt, we go through about 90 lbs a month, so I wanted something affordable but quality and this fits the bill.

The mishmash of textures makes it difficult to portion out the leaves and results in a lot of the small stuff making its way through the infuser of my <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0010NR7C0"">Bodum YoYo Personal Tea Set with Infuser and 12-Ounce Glass</a> (admittedly, a finer meshed infuser might not have as much of an issue here).  Also, the wide range of textures indicates (to me) that these tea leaves might not necessarily have been chosen for inclusion.  Instead, it feels like they might just have been leftovers from other processes (that's merely my non-knowledgeable feelings and not based on any hard facts).  On a positive note, I will say that the steeped beverage does have a very nice yellowish green color.  Overall, though, I have to rate this tea at a not-very-good 2 stars out of 5.

The pouch has lots of room in it for the tea to unfurl for richer flavor. No glue, no staples. And it's stitched with unbleached cotton thread; the company is careful with details to maximize your tea drinking experience and to keep it healthy for you and good for the environment.<br /><br />The tea is full-bodied, rich, and smooth. You can taste the vanilla in it, but it's a clean and subtle taste, not artificial tasting like some vanilla teas. It is my favorite vanilla black tea, and one of my favorite all-time teas.

I really had high hopes for this product, especially since I had to buy a whole case of it in order to try it, because it is not sold in individual boxes in any store near me.  But, upon popping this popcorn at work, the first thing I noticed was that the smell is extremely strong, and it permeated the whole office (which is quite large) and many people objected to the ""chemically"" smell of this popcorn.  When I open the bag, there are fumes that come out at first that actually make my eyes water, they are that chemically and so strong.  However, I personally felt that the taste of this popcorn was okay -- not good or great, just okay.  I much prefer the Jolly Time Kettle Corn flavor.  The smell of this popcorn bothered my coworkers so much that someone actually put an anonymous sign on the microwave asking people (me) NOT to pop popcorn in it anymore.  And the smell permeated the microwave literally for DAYS, coming back just as strong when anyone cooked ANYTHING in the microwave!  I am on Weight Watchers and since I bought a whole case of this, I tried bringing a bag to an office party one day to snack on myself instead of the cakes and cookies everyone else was having, and they actually made me LEAVE the party!<br /><br />So, if you don't mind being a social outcast, or having people criticize you for putting all those ""nasty chemicals"" in your body, or if you plan to eat this in the privacy of your own home -- then by all means, enjoy!

My other dog doesn't but he doesn't like any kibble anyways, so it isn't this food's fault.<br />3. Food quality is good. No by-products or corn or any other garbage (like unknown sources of bone and meat meals, etc).<br />4. No more ethoxyquin in any taste of the wild products!<br /><br />Cons:<br />1. Dogs seem to poop more on this food than other brands such as Orijen or Wellness. Not a lot more though so this isn't really a biggie.<br />2. Made by diamond Pet foods. Not really a biggie either, but diamond pet foods had been plagued with pet recalls problems in the past. Taste of the Wild hasn't had any recalls that I know of, but you're still running a risk, just a really small one.<br /><br />Compared to other brands, this is probably 4 out of 5, but it would be unfair because this brand is much cheaper.

We keep a small bag in the car for travel to reinforce when our puppy doesn't bark at people walking by, one by the door to reinforce when she goes to the bathroom outside, and a bunch of treats in a treat bag for travel.<br /><br />The one downside to these is that because they're not as stinky, it can be harder to use them to get your dog's attention if he or she is distracted, like at the dog park or if you have a bunch of visitors.  Our trick to get around this is that we put some stinky treats in the treat bag with these, and they'll take on some of the scent (We use <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002DGRSY"">Pro-Treat Beef Liver, Freeze Dried Dog Treats, 21 Ounce</a>).<br /><br />Our dog loves all flavors.",0.99723744

If you make a cup as directed with three parts water to one part milk, or even go as far as one part water to three parts milk if you really like it richer, and just add a little sugar (you don't need as much sugar as with other teas, because of the vanilla flavor), you end up with something so good that it tastes like a chai latte from a cafe. The flavor is rich and warm and the vanilla really comes through in the flavor and adds an extra dimension that lends even better if you take your chai with milk. It is not very spicy though (in terms of ""hot"" spicy) - it doesn't give you that slight kick at the backend of the flavor, like the one you would get with a Starbucks chai latte or with the Tazo chai, so if you like your chai with more zing I suppose you could add your own extra ginger or peppercorns.<br />I cannot find this tea in any stores near me, especially for the price that Amazon has, but the shipping is so slow!

Due to the high protein, a batter of chickpea flour and water can behave rather like an egg batter when you use it to dip foods for frying. In addition, it's used in a number of Indian sweets that are somewhat like fudge or nougat.<br /><br />If you want a really great recipe for zucchini pakoras, or fritters, it's so simple, you'll want to make these frequently. You can also use large white mushroom slices, Vidalia onion rings, even thinly sliced potato or sweet potato. Slices of cauliflower, carrot and whole trimmed green beans work, too. Here's the recipe:<br /><br />1 cup Chickpea Flour<br />1/2 cup water<br />1 tsp Garam Masala (Indian spice mix)<br />2 tsp each, grated gingerroot and mashed garlic<br />1/2 tsp ground chili pepper<br /><br />Mix this up until it's nice and smooth. This is your batter.<br /><br />Thinly slice (1/4 inch) zucchini, or mushrooms, onions (make into rings), potatoes or use a mix of these vegetables. Dip each piece into the batter and coat well. Fry in a cast iron skillet with a shallow layer of vegetable oil (you don't need more than a 1/4 to a 1/2 inch of oil.) When the fritters are caramel-brown on one side, flip and cook the other side. Drain on paper towels and sprinkle lightly with coarse sea salt, if you like. I use tongs to flip the vegetables. These are fantastic as appetizers or a quick snack.",0.9969071

Also, there is an advantage to getting active dry yeast as opposed to cake yeast.  It has low moisture content, giving it longer shelf life.  The shelf life of active dry yeast is 2 years from the package date, but it's advisable to use it within a year.  If frozen, it can last for over 10 years.  The main disadvantage is that it's more vulnerable to thermal shock than other baking yeasts.<br /><br />As an alternative to dry active yeast, you might prefer instant yeast.  Unlike active dry yeast, it doesn't require rehydration, plus it is has a much higher percentage of live cells.  Some people swear by it.

The weekend was a success, and my friend now has a new treat to offer her dog. This was pretty hard and I wonder how good it would be for a small or small/medium sized dogs teeth. I suppose the hardness helps to remove the plaque. I suspect it would take more than a weekend to evaluate how well it cleans, and I'm sure that you still will have to take your dog for cleanings, though I don't know the frequency. I would guess this would give you a little more time in between cleanings. I think the most important thing is that a dog with picky tastes enjoyed it and also did not get sick from it.

To begin with, the packaging for the coffee was not intact when it arrived.  The outer plastic bag had a hole torn in the bottom and the product package was ripped at its side seam, so coffee beans were scattered through the shipping box.  Just a visual inspection of the dark beans with a glint of oil sheen told me that this was certainly NOT light roast (why can't the coffee delivered match the coffee ordered?).  I went ahead and ground a batch of beans and made a pot of coffee using the same technique we use for our usual coffee (Allegro Organic varieties, which I promise are fantastic).  Even before the first sip, I knew there was a problem - the stuff smelled a little bit like a wet dog.  This off-putting aroma was a warning that I should have heeded, as the first sip was incredibly flat except for a stale cardboard-like taste.  In desperation, I added a bit of cream even though we always have our usual (excellent Allegro Organics) coffee black.  That desperate move was just an insult to the cream.  The coffee in the mug and the entire pot went down the sink.  Oh, and the icing here is that this item cannot be returned.<br />So, what went wrong with this very large bag of coffee?  Even though I ordered a light roast and was provided a dark roast, there must have been some problems with the storage of this particular bag.  I cannot imagine such a flat, stale flavor from any proper coffee bean grown on the planet, so this bag must have seen a few years in a warehouse without climate control.  The compromised packaging certainly could not have helped.  My advice to you would be to look for a different coffee item - unfortunately, Amazon is not selling the Allegro Organics.",0.040073372

I bought these cookies in January of 2010, and they are good until 9-2010, which is important to me, since I hate eating rancid food, so I just throw it out.  I've always loved these cookies, and my market sells them for much more than the subscribe price, so I'm happy to subscribe and save.  I love currants, and it's hard to find things flavored with them.  I have to admit, the currant taste is not strong, but they are delicious anyway, and I love the puff pastry.  Further, I'm allergic to GMO corn starch (genetically modified corn starch)- and just try to find cookies in US stores without corn starch (and 95% of all corn is modified in the US, and does not have to be labeled so).  So these are a real treat for me- since they are a cookie I can actually eat.<br /><br />The cookies are flaky, as puff pastry always is, and slightly sweet.  As other people have said, this is not a terribly sweet cookie, but it is quite sweet enough.  I enjoy mine with tea, and I also take them in my lunch.

Simmons,17,17,5,1330992000,Smells Great; Makes Things Taste Great,"Several years ago, I started making homemade marshmallows for family and friends.  You'd be amazed at the simple joy that radiates from the face of a person learning for the first time that marshmallows can be made at home.  Anyway, as a special treat for a friend who  is so enamored with France that she grows French lavender in her backyard because it reminds her of her travels there, I decided to try a lavender marshmallow.<br /><br />I was able to find some culinary lavender in my local grocery store (near a pretty urban area), but it seemed so expensive.  In the end, this is about a fifth of the price of my grocery store.  Win!  When I got the package in the mail, I could smell the floral, almost woodsy and astringent fragrance that I associate with lavender (and rosemary) before even opening it.  The color of the flower buds ranged from shades of blue to purple.<br /><br />To cook with it, I dump what I need into a large bowl and use the sprayer on my faucet to put enough water in the bowl so that the flowers float.  I give it a stir and then use a small-gauge strainer to scrape the floating flowers out of the water.  Any detritus that may be mixed in with the flowers will sink to the bottom (though any stems will not - but then again, rosemary and thyme typically have some stems mixed in), so don't just dump it in the strainer.  Glean the flowers from the top of the bowl.<br /><br />As for my marshmallows, which I topped with lavender-scented dark chocolate, my friend loved them and everything I've made since (lavender lemon cookies, blueberry lavender syrup, lavender cream, lavender, thyme, and rosemary roasted potatoes, lavender butter, strawberry lavender butter, etc.) has been quite delicious.  When I need more lavender, I know where to come.<br /><br />Update:  I also wanted to mention that 1 oz. of lavender is about 1.25 cups.",0.9980647

After going out on a limb and ordering this I decided to try it myself.<br /><br />First - the packaging. The plastic bottle itself is a bit cumbersome - sometimes I have give it an iron grip squeeze in order to get the honey out. It does really give off that ""hometown raw"" aesthetic though.<br /><br />Second - the consistency & color. My wife and I prefer raw honey and have tried various other brands (whole foods, farmers markets) and usually the consistency of the other brands is an extremely thick goo, which you have to spoon out. What's refreshing about this honey is how smooth it is. Another thing with the other brands of raw honey is the color. The other brands I've tried have a dark amber color (resembles apple butter almost), however, this honey although slightly darker than regular grocery store bought honey, it still has a fairly normal color. My guess for the lighter color is attributed to the raw purity of this kind of honey.<br /><br />Third - and lastly the taste. This is the primary reason why I give this honey five stars. Although as I mentioned the packaging is a bit cumbersome, I'd eat this honey if it came in a bowling ball. Well, maybe not, but you get the point. The taste is what matters. This honey is hands down the tastiest honey I've ever had in my entire life. It's sweet but not overbearing and no bitter aftertaste like other honeys I've tried. You MUST try this honey at least once in your life. It's refreshing to know that I no longer need to look anymore for great honey - I'm a customer for life.",0.9768734
